rules. {header}, please do one of the following:

- You can download a patch with my suggested changes \
  [here]({url}/artifacts/raw/style.patch), inspect it and make \
  changes manually.
- You can directly apply it to your repository by running \
  `curl {url}/artifacts/raw/style.patch | git apply -`.
- You can run `maintainer/CI/fix_style.sh` to automatically fix your coding \
  style. This is the same command that I have executed to generate the patch \
  above, but it requires certain tools to be installed on your computer.

You can run `gitlab-runner exec docker style` afterwards to check if your \
changes worked out properly.

Please note that there are often multiple ways to correctly format code. \
As I am just a robot, I sometimes fail to identify the most aesthetically \
pleasing way. So please look over my suggested changes and adapt them \
where the style does not make sense.\
