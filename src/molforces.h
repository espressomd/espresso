/** \file molforces.h
 *  Routines for calculating and applying trap forces upon molecules.
 *  This trap force can be set to
 *  - a harmonic potential with a restlength of zero on the molecular centre of mass
 *  - a drag on the molecular velocity
 *  - a cancelation of the total force on the molecule (including thermostat forces)
 *  The centre of mass can be fixed to an absolute position or to a relative position in the
 *  simulation box.
 *  The molecular trap forces is distributed evenly upon all particles in a molecule.
 *  (see file \ref topology.c and file \ref molforces.c)
