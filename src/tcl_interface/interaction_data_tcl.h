/** \file interaction_data.h
    Various procedures concerning interactions between particles.

    interaction_data.h contains the parser \ref tclcommand_inter for the
    Tcl command "inter". Therefore the parsing of bonded and nonbonded
    interaction definition commands both is done here. It also contains
    procedures for low-level interactions setup and some helper functions.
    Moreover it contains code for the treatments of constraints.
