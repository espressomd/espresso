/** \file mmm1d.h MMM1D algorithm for long range coulomb interactions.
    Implementation of the MMM1D method for the calculation of the
    electrostatic interaction in one dimensionally periodic
    systems. For details on the method see MMM in general. The MMM1D
    method works only with the nsquared \ref tclcommand_cellsystem
    "cell system", since neither the near nor far formula can be
    decomposed. However, this implementation is reasonably fast, so
    that one can use up to 200 charges easily in a simulation.  */
