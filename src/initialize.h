/** \file initialize.h This file contains the hook procedures. These
    are the ones with names on_* and are called whenever something is
    changed in Espresso which might influence other parts. For
    example, the P3M code has to be reinitialized whenever the box
    size changes. The hooking mechanism allows to keep track of such
    changes.

    For this mechanism to work, two things have to be fulfilled. If
    some part of the code changes some property, it has to call the
    corresponding hook, i. e. on_particle_change if a particle
    property has been changed or on_short_range_ia_change, if a short
    ranged interaction has been changed.  In turn procedures that
    depend on particle properties or the box size, should react to
    such changes in the corresponding hook procedure.
 */

/** \name Hook procedures
    These procedures are called if several significant changes to
    the system happen which may make a reinitialization of subsystems
    necessary. Note that all these functions are called on ALL nodes.
    if you need to do something only on the master node, check
    \ref this_node == 0. The use of the asynchronous mpi_* functions
    (e. g. mpi_bcast_parameter) on the master node is possible.
