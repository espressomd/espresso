/** \file mmm2d.h MMM2D algorithm for long range coulomb interaction
    in 2d+h geometries.  Implementation of the MMM2D method for the
    calculation of the electrostatic interaction for two dimensionally
    periodic systems. For details on the method see MMM general. The
    MMM2D method works only with the layered or nsquared \ref
    tclcommand_cellsystem "cell system". The tuning is not automated,
    since the only tunable parameter is the cell size, which can be
    changed easily in Tcl. Moreover, only a few values make sense to
    be tested, since in general the number of cells will be between 5
    and 20.
