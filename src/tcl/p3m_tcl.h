/** Tune P3M parameters to desired accuracy.

    Usage:
    \verbatim inter coulomb <bjerrum> p3m tune accuracy <value> [r_cut <value> mesh <value> cao <value>] \endverbatim

    The parameters are tuned to obtain the desired accuracy in best
    time, by running mpi_integrate(0) for several parameter sets.

    The function utilizes the analytic expression of the error estimate 
    for the P3M method in the book of Hockney and Eastwood (Eqn. 8.23) in 
    order to obtain the rms error in the force for a system of N randomly 
    distributed particles in a cubic box.
    For the real space error the estimate of Kolafa/Perram is used. 

    Parameter range if not given explicit values: For \ref p3m_struct::r_cut_iL
    the function uses the values (\ref min_local_box_l -\ref #skin) /
    (n * \ref box_l), n being an integer (this implies the assumption that \ref
    p3m_struct::r_cut_iL is the largest cutoff in the system!). For \ref
    p3m_struct::mesh the function uses the two values which matches best the
    equation: number of mesh point = number of charged particles. For
    \ref p3m_struct::cao the function considers all possible values.

    For each setting \ref p3m_struct::alpha_L is calculated assuming that the
    error contributions of real and reciprocal space should be equal.

    After checking if the total error fulfils the accuracy goal the
    time needed for one force calculation (including verlet list
    update) is measured via \ref mpi_integrate (0).

    The function returns a log of the performed tuning.

    The function is based on routines of the program HE_Q.c written by M. Deserno.
