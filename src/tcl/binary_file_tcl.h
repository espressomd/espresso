/** \file binary_file_tcl.h
    This file defines a binary file format for the particle data.

The functions in this file are no longer supported by the Espresso
team. Use them at your own risk!

    It is the header file for \ref binary_file_tcl.c "binary_file_tcl.c" and provides
    functions to read and write binary particle data to Tcl channels.
    It also defines the structures and constants necessary to interprete/
    generate particle data files in this format. THE FILE FORMAT IS HARDWARE
    DEPENDENT, SINCE RAW DATA TYPES ARE WRITTEN!!!

    <p>
    The file format conists of the following:
    <ol>
    <li> \ref MDHeader with \ref MDHeader::magic set to \ref MDMAGIC ("MD01") without trailing 0.
    <li> then \ref MDHeader::n_rows chars out of
    \ref POSX,\ref POSY,\ref POSZ,\ref VX,\ref VY,\ref VZ,\ref FX,\ref FY,\ref FZ,
    \ref Q,\ref TYPE which determine the data that is contained in the following and
    correspond to the respective fields of \ref Particle.
    <li> now follows the particle data, always starting with one integer giving the
    particles identity (this row is NOT defined before!), then the data for the fields
    as defined before. The data types
    for \ref POSX,\ref POSY,\ref POSZ,\ref VX,\ref VY,\ref VZ,\ref FX,\ref FY,\ref FZ,
    \ref Q are double, for \ref TYPE integer.
    <li> The file is finished with a single integer -1 (replacing the particle identity
    of a subsequent particle).
    </ol>
