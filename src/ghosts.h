/** \file ghosts.h    Ghost particles and particle exchange.
 
In this file you find everything concerning the exchange of
particle data (particles, ghosts, positions and forces) for short
range interactions between the spacial domains of neighbouring
nodes.

<h2> How does this work </h2>
The ghost communication transfers data from cells on one node to cells on another node during
the integration process. Note that data can only be transferred from one cell to one other, and
the contents of the other cell will be overwritten. This communication is invoked by the integrator,
at four different times in an integration step. These steps are reflected in \ref cell_structure structure,
since they are treated differently by different cell systems:
<ul>
<li> ghost_cells is used to transfer the cell sizes, i. e. makes sure that for all later transfers
      the target cell has the same size as the source cell.
<li> exchange_ghosts sets up all information on the ghosts that is necessary. Normally transfers the
      (shifted) position and particle properties.
<li> update_ghosts is used to update the particle properties if no particles have been moved between cells.
      Therefore only the positions are transferred, otherwise this normally looks pretty much like the
      exchange_ghosts.
<li> collect_ghost_forces finally is used to transfer back forces that were exerted on a ghost particle. They
      are simply added again to the force of the real particle. The communication process is therefore inverted
      with respect to exchange_ghosts and update_ghosts, i. e. sending is replaced by receiving and the other way
      round.
</ul>
The particle data that has to be transferred, and especially from where to where, heavily depends on the cell system.
In Espresso, this is abstracted in form of ghost communicators (\ref GhostCommunicator) and ghost communications
(\ref GhostCommunication). The ghost communicators represent the four communications above and consist of the data to
transfer (which is determined by their type) and a list of ghost communications.
The data types are described by the particle data classes
<ul>
<li> GHOSTTRANS_PROPRTS transfers the \ref ParticleProperties
<li> GHOSTTRANS_POSITION transfers the \ref ParticlePosition
<li> GHOSTTRANS_POSSHFTD is no transfer class, but marks that an additional vector, the shift, has to be
      added to the positions. Can only be used together with GHOSTTRANS_POSITION.
<li> GHOSTTRANS_MOMENTUM transfers the \ref ParticleMomentum
<li> GHOSTTRANS_FORCE transfers the \ref ParticleForce
<li> GHOSTTRANS_PARTNUM transfers the cell sizes
</ul>
Each ghost communication describes a single communication of the local with another node (or all other nodes). The data
transferred can be any number of cells, there are five communication types:
<ul>
<li> GHOST_SEND sends data to one other node
<li> GHOST_RECV recvs data from one other node. In the case of forces, they are added up, everything else is overwritten
<li> GHOST_BCST sends data to all nodes
<li> GHOST_RDCE recvs data from all nodes.  In the case of forces, they are added up, everything else is overwritten
<li> GHOST_LOCL transfer data from a local cell to another local cell. In this case, the first half of the cells are the sending cells,
      the other half are the corresponding receivers.
</ul>
Note that for the first four communications you have to make sure that when one node sends to another, that the sender has GHOST_SEND and the
receiver GHOST_RECV. In the case of GHOST_BCST rsp. GHOST_RDCE, all nodes have to have the same communication type and the same master
sender/receiver (just like the MPI commands).

A special topic are GHOST_PREFETCH and GHOST_PSTSTORE. For example, if all nodes broadcast to the other, the naive implementation will be that
n_nodes times a GHOST_BCST is done with different master nodes. But this means that each time n_nodes-1 nodes wait for the master to construct
its send buffer. Therefore there is the prefetch flag which can be set on a pair of recv/send operations. If the ghost communication reaches a
recv operation with prefetch, the next send operation (which must have the prefetch set!!) is searched and the send buffer already created.
When sending, this precreated send buffer is used. In the scenario above, all nodes create the send buffers simultaneously in the first
communication step, thereby reducing the latency a little bit. The pststore is similar and postpones the write back of received data until a
send operation (with a precreated send buffer) is finished.

The ghost communicators are created in the init routines of the cell systems, therefore have a look at \ref dd_topology_init or
\ref nsq_topology_init for further details.
