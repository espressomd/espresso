/**
 * @brief Manager to control the lifetime of shared resources.
 *
 * Resources that need to be available globally, for example
 * via singletons, need to expire after all objects that depend
 * on them have already expired.
 * When static objects reside in different translation units, they
 * can expire in any order, potentially creating race conditions
 * if one static object relies on the other it its destructor.
 *
 * This class "locks" resources by storing a shared pointer to them,
 * ensuring that the resources lifetime is extended by the lifetime
 * of the class instance. Client code can then keep this class
 * instance alive until the resources are no longer needed, at which
 * point the class instance can be released. Type erasure hides
 * implementation details of the resources being locked.
 *
 * Multiple resources can be locked, using a LIFO (last-in, first-out)
 * container to ensure that resources are freed in a controlled order.
 * This design choice avoids undefined behavior due to race conditions,
 * which may occur if one global resource's destruction depends on the
 * existence of another global resource. This behavior cannot be achieved
 * with STL containers like @p std::stack or @p std::vector, since the
 * destruction order of the stored data is under-specified.
