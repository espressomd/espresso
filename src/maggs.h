/** \file maggs.h
 *  Maxwell Equations Molecular Dynamics (MEMD) method for electrostatic
 *  interactions.
 *
 *  We use a local update scheme to propagate artificial B-fields on a
 *  lattice in the system. In principal, the algorithm simulates full
 *  electrodynamics, but with a tunable speed of light.
 *
 *  The method is very usable for large particle numbers or highly
 *  parallel architectures, since it is local and scales linearly.
 *  It is not suited for high-precision calculation of forces, since
 *  the simple interpolation scheme produces errors in the order of
 *  10^-5 in the force.
 *
 *  The chosen mesh should roughly be of the size of the particles.
 *
 *  Further reading on the algorithm:
