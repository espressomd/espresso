/** \file ljangle.h
 *  Routines to calculate the lennard-jones 12-10 with angular dependance.
 *  The potential is a product of a 12-10 LJ potential with two cos^2.
 *  The potential actually relies on 6 particles: the 2 primary beads
 *  and each bead needs two other particles to define an orientation.
 *  We calculate the interaction explicitly *without* the use of the ROTATION feature.
 *
 *  Optional: simulate two different environments in which the interaction
 *  strengths differ. For example: simulate hydrogen-bonds both in water and
 *  inside a bilayer. The two environments are distinguished by their
 *  z-position. Input: the midplane of the 2nd environment, its total
 *  thickness, the thickness of the interface, and the value of the
 *  interaction strength in this medium. The interaction strengh of the second
 *  environment must be *stronger* than of the first one.
