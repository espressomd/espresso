/** \file layered.h
    The layered cellsystem. This cellsystem is a combination of a single processor n-squared method along x and y,
    and a multiprocessor domain decomposition along z. Therefore only \f$1\times 1\times N\f$ processors grids are
    allowed for this cellsystem. The implementation is pretty similar to
    \ref domain_decomposition.h "domain_decomposition.h".
