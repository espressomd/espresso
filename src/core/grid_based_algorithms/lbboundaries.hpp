/** \file

 * Boundary conditions for lattice Boltzmann fluid dynamics.
 * Header file for \ref lbboundaries.cpp.
 *
 * In the current version only simple bounce back walls are implemented. Thus
 * after the streaming step, in all wall nodes all populations are bounced
 * back from where they came from. Ulf Schiller spent a lot of time
 * working on more powerful alternatives, they are to be found in the
 * lb_testing branch of espresso until the end of 2010. Now we stripped
 * down the code to a minimum, as most of it was not sufficiently
 * understandable.
 *
 * Anyone who wants to revive these, please look into the git.
