 *                       - -1: recalculate forces unconditionally
 *                         (mostly used for timing)
 *                       - 0: recalculate forces if @ref recalc_forces is set,
 *                         meaning it is probably necessary
 *                       - 1: do not recalculate forces (mostly when reading

 *
 *  @details This function calls two hooks for propagation kernels such as
 *  velocity verlet, velocity verlet + npt box changes, and steepest_descent.
 *  One hook is called before and one after the force calculation.
 *  It is up to the propagation kernels to increment the simulation time.
 *
 *  This function propagates the system according to the choice of integrator
 *  stored in @ref integ_switch. The general structure is:
 *  - if reuse_forces is zero, recalculate the forces based on the current
 *    state of the system
 *  - Loop over the number of simulation steps:
 *    -# initialization (e.g., RATTLE)
 *    -# First hook for propagation kernels
 *    -# Update dependent particles and properties (RATTLE, virtual sites)
 *    -# Calculate forces for the current state of the system. This includes
 *       forces added by the Langevin thermostat and the
 *       Lattice-Boltzmann-particle coupling
 *    -# Second hook for propagation kernels
 *    -# Update dependent properties (Virtual sites, RATTLE)
 *    -# Run single step algorithms (Lattice-Boltzmann propagation, collision
 *       detection, NpT update)
 *  - Final update of dependent properties and statistics/counters
 *
 *  High-level documentation of the integration and thermostatting schemes
 *  can be found in doc/sphinx/system_setup.rst and /doc/sphinx/running.rst
