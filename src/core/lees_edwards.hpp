/** \file lees_edwards.h
    Data and methods for Lees-Edwards periodic boundary conditions.  The gist of LE-PBCs is to impose shear flow
    by constantly moving the PBC wrap such that:  $x_{unfolded} == x_{folded} + x_{img} \times L  + (y_{img} * \gamma * t)$,
    and $vx_{unfolded} =  vx_{folded} + (y_{img} * \gamma)$.
