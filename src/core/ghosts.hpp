/** \file
 *  Ghost particles and particle exchange.
 *
 *  In this file you find everything concerning the exchange of
 *  particle data (particles, ghosts, positions and forces) for short
 *  range interactions between the spacial domains of neighbouring
 *  nodes.
 *
 *  <h2> How does this work </h2>
 *  The ghost communication transfers data from cells on one node to cells on
 *  another node during the integration process. Note that data can only be
 *  transferred from one cell to one other, and the contents of the other cell
 *  will be overwritten. This communication is invoked by the integrator, at
 *  four different times in an integration step. These steps are reflected in
 *  @ref cell_structure structure, since they are treated differently by
 *  different cell systems:
 *  - @ref CellStructure::m_ghost_cells are used to transfer the cell sizes,
 *    i.e., make sure that for all later transfers the target cell has the same
 *    size as the source cell.
 *  - @ref CellStructure::exchange_ghosts_comm sets up all information on the
 *    ghosts that is necessary. Normally transfers the (shifted) position and
 *    particle properties.
 *  - @ref cells_update_ghosts is used to update the particle properties if no
 *    particles have been moved between cells. Therefore only the positions are
 *    transferred, otherwise this normally looks pretty much like the
 *    @ref CellStructure::exchange_ghosts_comm.
 *  - @ref CellStructure::collect_ghost_force_comm finally is used to transfer
 *    back forces that were exerted on a ghost particle. They are simply added
 *    again to the force of the real particle. The communication process is
 *    therefore inverted with respect to
 *    @ref CellStructure::exchange_ghosts_comm and @ref cells_update_ghosts,
 *    i.e., sending is replaced by receiving and the other way round.
 *
 *  The particle data that has to be transferred, and especially from where to
 *  where, heavily depends on the cell system. In ESPResSo, this is abstracted
 *  in form of ghost communicators (\ref GhostCommunicator) and ghost
 *  communications (\ref GhostCommunication). The ghost communicators represent
 *  the four communications above and consist of the data to transfer (which is
 *  determined by their type) and a list of ghost communications. The data
 *  types are described by the particle data classes:
 *  - @ref GHOSTTRANS_PROPRTS transfers the @ref ParticleProperties
 *  - @ref GHOSTTRANS_POSITION transfers the @ref ParticlePosition
 *  - @ref GHOSTTRANS_MOMENTUM transfers the @ref ParticleMomentum
 *  - @ref GHOSTTRANS_FORCE transfers the @ref ParticleForce
 *  - @ref GHOSTTRANS_PARTNUM transfers the cell sizes
 *
 *  Each ghost communication describes a single communication of the local with
 *  another node (or all other nodes). The data transferred can be any number
 *  of cells, there are five communication types:
 *  - @ref GHOST_SEND sends data to one other node
 *  - @ref GHOST_RECV recvs data from one other node. In the case of
 *    forces, they are added up, everything else is overwritten
 *  - @ref GHOST_BCST sends data to all nodes
 *  - @ref GHOST_RDCE recvs data from all nodes. In the case of
 *    forces, they are added up, everything else is overwritten
 *  - @ref GHOST_LOCL transfer data from a local cell to another local cell.
 *    In this case, the first half of the cells are the sending cells, the
 *    other half are the corresponding receivers.
 *
 *  Note that for the first four communications you have to make sure that
 *  when one node sends to another, that the sender has @ref GHOST_SEND
 *  and the receiver @ref GHOST_RECV. In the case of @ref GHOST_BCST resp.
 *  @ref GHOST_RDCE, all nodes have to have the same communication type
 *  and the same master sender/receiver (just like the MPI commands).
 *
 *  A special topic are @ref GHOST_PREFETCH and @ref GHOST_PSTSTORE. For
 *  example, if all nodes broadcast to the other, the naive implementation will
 *  be that @c n_nodes times a @ref GHOST_BCST is done with different master
 *  nodes. But this means that each time <tt>n_nodes - 1</tt> nodes wait for
 *  the master to construct its send buffer. Therefore there is the prefetch
 *  flag which can be set on a pair of recv/send operations. If the ghost
 *  communication reaches a recv operation with prefetch, the next send
 *  operation (which must have the prefetch set!!) is searched and the send
 *  buffer already created. When sending, this precreated send buffer is used.
 *  In the scenario above, all nodes create the send buffers simultaneously in
 *  the first communication step, thereby reducing the latency a little bit.
 *  The pststore is similar and postpones the write back of received data
 *  until a send operation (with a precreated send buffer) is finished.
 *
 *  The ghost communicators are created in the init routines of the cell
 *  systems, therefore have a look at @ref dd_topology_init or
 *  @ref nsq_topology_init for further details.
