/** \file mmm1d.hpp MMM1D algorithm for long range coulomb interactions.
    Implementation of the MMM1D method for the calculation of the electrostatic
    interaction in one dimensionally periodic systems. For details on the
    method see MMM in general. The MMM1D method works only with the nsquared,
    since neither the near nor far formula can be decomposed. However, this
    implementation is reasonably fast, so that one can use up to 200 charges
    easily in a simulation.  */
