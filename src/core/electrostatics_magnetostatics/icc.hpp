    ICCP3M is a method that allows to take into account the influence
    of arbitrarily shaped dielectric interfaces.  The dielectric
    properties of a dielectric medium in the bulk of the simulation
    box are taken into account by reproducing the jump in the electric
    field at the inface with charge surface segments. The charge
    density of the surface segments have to be determined
    self-consistently using an iterative scheme.  It can at presently
    - despite its name - be used with P3M, ELCP3M, MMM2D and MMM1D.
    For details see:<br> S. Tyagi, M. Suzen, M. Sega, C. Holm,
    M. Barbosa: A linear-scaling method for computing induced charges
    on arbitrary dielectric boundaries in large system simulations
    (Preprint)

    To set up ICCP3M first the dielectric boundary has to be modelled
    by espresso particles 0..n where n has to be passed as a parameter
    to ICCP3M. This is still a bit inconvenient, as it forces the user
    to reserve the first n particle ids to wall charges, but as the
    other parts of espresso do not suffer from a limitation like this,
    it can be tolerated.

    For the determination of the induced charges only the forces
    acting on the induced charges has to be determined. As P3M and the
    other Coulomb solvers calculate all mutual forces, the force
    calculation was modified to avoid the calculation of the short
    range part of the source-source force calculation.  For different
    particle data organisation schemes this is performed differently.
