/** \file
 *  MMM1D algorithm for long range %Coulomb interactions.
 *  Implementation of the MMM1D method for the calculation of the electrostatic
 *  interaction in one-dimensionally periodic systems. For details on the
 *  method see MMM in general. The MMM1D method works only with the nsquared,
 *  since neither the near nor far formula can be decomposed. However, this
 *  implementation is reasonably fast, so that one can use up to 200 charges
 *  easily in a simulation.
