/** \file
 *  main header-file for MDLC (magnetic dipolar layer correction).
 *
 *  Developer: Joan J. Cerda.
 *  Purpose:   get the corrections for dipolar 3D algorithms
 *             when applied to a slab geometry and dipolar
 *             particles. DLC & co
 *  Article:   A. Brodka, Chemical Physics Letters 400, 62-67 (2004).
 *
 *             We also include a tuning function that returns the
 *             cut-off necessary to attend a certain accuracy.
 *
 *  Restrictions: the slab must be such that the z is the short
 *                direction. Otherwise we get trash.
 *
 *  Limitations:  at this moment it is restricted to work with 1 cpu
