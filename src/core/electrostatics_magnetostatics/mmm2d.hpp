/** \file
    MMM2D algorithm for long range Coulomb interaction
    in 2d+h geometries.  Implementation of the MMM2D method for the calculation
    of the electrostatic interaction for two dimensionally periodic systems.
    For details on the method see MMM general. The MMM2D method works only with
    the layered or nsquared  "cell system".  The tuning is not automated, since
    the only tunable parameter is the cell size, which can be changed easily in
    Tcl. Moreover, only a few values make sense to be tested, since in general
    the number of cells will be between 5 and 20.
