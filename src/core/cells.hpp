/**
 * @file
 * This file contains everything related to the global cell structure / cell
 * system.
 *
 * The cell system (@ref CellStructure) describes how particles are
 * distributed on the cells and how particles of different cells
 * (regardless if they reside on the same or different nodes)
 * interact with each other. The following cell systems are implemented:
 *
 * - regular decomposition: The simulation box is divided spatially
 *   into cells (see @ref RegularDecomposition.hpp). This is suitable for
 *   short-range interactions.
 * - N-square: The particles are distributed equally on all nodes
 *   regardless their spatial position (see @ref AtomDecomposition.hpp).
 *   This is suitable for long-range interactions that cannot be treated
 *   by a special method like P3M.
 * - hybrid decomposition: Initializes both regular decomposition
 *   and N-square at the same time and is given a set of particle types
 *   @c n_square_types (see @ref HybridDecomposition.hpp). By default,
 *   particles will be distributed using the regular decomposition.
 *   For particles of the types defined as @c n_square_types the N-square
 *   method is used. This is suitable for systems containing lots of small
 *   particles with short-range interactions mixed with a few large
 *   particles with long-range interactions. There, the large particles
 *   should be treated using N-square.
