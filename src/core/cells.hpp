/** \file
 *  This file contains everything related to the global cell structure / cell
 *  system.
 *
 *  The cell system (\ref CellStructure) describes how particles are
 *  distributed on the cells and how particles of different cells
 *  (regardless if they reside on the same or different nodes)
 *  interact with each other. The following cell systems are implemented:
 *
 *  - domain decomposition: The simulation box is divided spatially
 *    into cells (see \ref DomainDecomposition.hpp). This is suitable for
 *    short range interactions.
 *  - nsquare: The particles are distributed equally on all nodes
 *    regardless their spatial position (see \ref AtomDecomposition.hpp).
 *    This is suitable for long range interactions that cannot be treated by a
 *    special method like P3M.
