/* * @File Header file for the correlation class
 *
 * This module allow to compute correlations (and other two time averages) on
 * the fly an from files.
 *
 * The basic idea is that the user can write arbitrary function A and B that
 * can depend on e.g. particle coordinates or whatever state of the MD box.
 * These function can be vector valued, always indicated by dim_A and dim_B.
 *
 * The way they can be correlated is can be formulated as a (vector valued)
 * operation on A and B. One example would be to calculate the product
 * component by component, and if A and B are both the particle velocities,
 * then one would obtain
 * { <v_1x v_1x(t)>  <v_1y v_1y(t)>  <v_1z v_1z(t)>  <v_2x v_2x(t)>  <v_2y
 * v_2y(t)>  <v_2z v_2z(t)> ... }
 *
 * The idea of the algorithm is not to keep all As and Bs in memory, but
 * feed the algorithm (or the container object) successively by new As and Bs
 * and new correlation estimates are calculated on the fly. Those As and Bs
 * which have exceeded a certain age are (first compressed, see below) and then
 * discarded.
 *
 * To save memory, increase statistics and make the calculation possible for
 * many orders of magnitude in time, the blocking algorithm in Frenkels book
 * (p.91)
 * is applied. Thus not all As and Bs of the whole "past" are stored but
 * some of them are blocked. In this implementation always a blocking based
 * on 2 is applied: All As and Bs not older than a certain tau_lin are stored
 * as they were, those which are older are not entire stored, but only
 * their compressed average value. All As and Bs older than 2*tau_lin
 * are compressed in blocks of four etc.
 *
 * This leads to a hierarchical "history": on level 0 the last tau_lin values
 * are stored. This is done in a cyclic array: The newest is always appended
 * at the end of the array, and if the array length is reached, values
 * are appended at the beginning, overwriting older values. We therefore
 * have to carry the index newest[0] which tells, what is the index of the
 * newest value of A and B.
 *
 * As soon as the first row of As and Bs is full, two of them are
 * compressed by calculating the arithmetic mean, and stored in the
 * first element on level 1. Then we can overwrite these two values
 * on level 0, because we have saved them. Always if necessary
 * we produce space on level 0 by compressing to level 1. On
 * level 1 also an array with tau_lin entries is available to store
 * the level-1-compressed values. It is successively filled
 * and also cyclic. When it is filled, the values are stored
 * on level 2 and so on.
 *
 * This allows to have a "history" over many orders of magnitude
 * in time, without the full memory effort.
 *
 * Correlations are only calculated on each level: For
 * tau=1,2,..,tau_lin the values are taken from level 1.
 * For tau=tau_lin, tau_lin+2, .., 2*tau_lin we take the values
 * from level 2. On level 2 we also have values for 0,..tau_lin-2,
 * but these are discarded as we have "better" estimates on level 1.
 *
 * The functions A and B can get extra arguments. This can e.g. be an
 * integer describing to the "type" of the particles to be considered,
 * or in case of files, it is a file_data_source pointer, which tells
 * the function from where to read. These arguments have to be a single
 * pointer to an object that carries all relevant information
 * to obtain A and B (from the MD Box or somewhere else).
 *
 * The correlation has to be initialized with all necessary information,
 * i.e. all function pointers, the dimensions of A and B and their dimensions
 * etc.
 * When new A and B values should be processed, a single call of
 * double_correlation_get_data(..) with the correlation object as an
 * argument is enough to update A and B and the correlation estimate.
 *
 * Eventually the correlation can be printed.
 *
 *
 * There is a lot of stuff to do:
 * ==============================
 * -> Write input functions that take TCL arrays for A and B to
 *  make the method available for TCL-coded variables
 * -> Expand the file_data_source so that one can specify which
 *  columns of the file are to be processed
 * -> Write more correlation operations (scalar product)
 * -> Write more observable
 * -> calculate an estimate of average values. This might be
 *  even necessary to calculate <(A-<A>)(B(tau)-<B>), which
 *  is often probably what people want
 * -> Use the A_args to calculate As and Bs only for particular
 *  particle types (especially and example, so that other people can follow)
 * -> Use the A_args to calculate molecular stuff in combination with
 *  the topology concept
 * -> Tidy up the parsers (just a bit)
 * -> Write some nice samples
 * -> Write a destructor
 * -> Finally: write the users guide
 *
