/** @brief Structure containing the information about the cell grid used for
 * domain decomposition.
 *
 *  The domain of a node is split into a 3D cell grid with dimension
 *  cell_grid. Together with one ghost cell
 *  layer on each side the overall dimension of the ghost cell grid is
 *  ghost_cell_grid. The domain
 *  decomposition enables one the use of the linked cell algorithm
 *  which is in turn used for setting up the Verlet list for the
 *  system. You can see a 2D graphical representation of the linked
 *  cell grid below.
 *
 *  \image html  linked_cells.gif "Linked cells structure"
 *
 *  2D representation of a linked cell grid: cell_grid =
 *  {4,4}, ghost_cell_grid = {6,6}
 *
 * Each cell has 3^D neighbor cells. Since we deal with pair forces, it is
 * sufficient to calculate only half of the interactions (Newton's law:
 * action = reaction). We have chosen the upper half e.g. all neighbor
 * cells with a higher linear index (for cell 14 they are marked in light
 * blue). Caution: This implementation needs double sided ghost
 * communication! For single sided ghost communication one would need
 * some ghost-ghost cell interaction as well, which we do not need!
