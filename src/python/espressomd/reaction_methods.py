class ReactionAlgorithm(ScriptInterfaceHelper):
    """

    This class provides the base class for Reaction Algorithms like
    the Reaction Ensemble algorithm and the constant pH method.
    Initialize the reaction algorithm by setting the
    standard pressure, temperature, and the exclusion range.

    Note: When creating particles the velocities of the new particles are set
    according the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. In this step the mass of the
    new particle is assumed to equal 1.


    Parameters
    ----------
    kT : :obj:`float`
        Thermal energy of the system in simulation units
    exclusion_range : :obj:`float`
        Minimal distance from any particle, within which new particles will not
        be inserted. 
    seed : :obj:`int`
        Initial counter value (or seed) of the Mersenne Twister RNG.
    exclusion_radius_per_type : :obj:`dict`, optional
         Mapping of particle types to exclusion radii.
    search_algorithm : :obj:`str`
        Pair search algorithm. Default is ``"order_n"``, which evaluates the
        distance between the inserted particle and all other particles in the
        system, which scales with O(N). For MPI-parallel simulations, the
        ``"parallel"`` method is faster. The ``"parallel"`` method is not
        recommended for simulations on 1 MPI rank, since it comes with the
        overhead of a ghost particle update.

    Methods
    -------
    remove_constraint()
        Remove any previously defined constraint.
        Requires setting the volume using :meth:`set_volume`.

    set_cylindrical_constraint_in_z_direction()
        Constrain the reaction moves within a cylinder aligned on the z-axis.
        Requires setting the volume using :meth:`set_volume`.

            y coordinate of center of the cylinder.

    set_wall_constraints_in_z_direction()

        working with :ref:`Electrostatic Layer Correction (ELC)`.

    get_wall_constraints_in_z_direction()
        Returns the restrictions of the sampling area in z-direction.

    set_volume()
        Set the volume to be used in the acceptance probability of the reaction
        ensemble. This can be useful when using constraints, if the relevant
        volume is different from the box volume. If not used the default volume
        which is used, is the box volume.

        Parameters
        ----------
        volume : :obj:`float`
            Volume of the system in simulation units

    get_volume()
        Get the volume to be used in the acceptance probability of the reaction
        ensemble.

    get_acceptance_rate_particle_displacement_MC_moves()
        Returns the acceptance rate for the configuration moves.

    get_acceptance_rate_reaction()
        Returns the acceptance rate for the given reaction.

        Parameters
        ----------
        reaction_id : :obj:`int`
            Reaction id

    set_non_interacting_type()
        Sets the particle type for non-interacting particles.
        Default value: 100.
        This is used to temporarily hide particles during a reaction trial
        move, if they are to be deleted after the move is accepted. Please
        change this value if you intend to use the type 100 for some other
        particle types with interactions, or if you need improved performance,
        as the default value of 100 causes some overhead.
        Please also note that particles
        in the current implementation of the Reaction Ensemble are only
        hidden with respect to Lennard-Jones and Coulomb interactions. Hiding
        of other interactions, for example a magnetic, needs to be implemented
        in the code.

        Parameters
        ----------
        type : :obj:`int`
            Particle type for the hidden particles

    get_non_interacting_type()
        Returns the type which is used for hiding particle

    reaction()
        Performs randomly selected reactions.

        Parameters
        ----------
        reaction_steps : :obj:`int`, optional
            The number of reactions to be performed at once, defaults to 1.

    do_particle_displacement_MC_move()
        Performs particle displacement MC moves in the canonical ensemble.
        New positions of the displaced particles are chosen from the whole box
        with a uniform probability distribution. When moved, the particles preserve
        their original velocity. By default, any particle can be selected to be moved,
        but the particles types allowed to moved can be selected with particle_types_to_move

        Parameters
        ----------
        mc_steps : :obj:`int`
            Number of trial MC steps
        particle_types_to_move : :obj:`list`
            List of particle types from which particles are selected. 
            If empty, any particle can be chosen by default.


    delete_particle()
        Deletes the particle of the given p_id and makes sure that the particle
        range has no holes. This function has some restrictions, as e.g. bonds
        are not deleted. Therefore only apply this function to simple ions.

        Parameters
        ----------
        p_id : :obj:`int`
            Id of the particle to be deleted.

    change_reaction_constant()
        Changes the reaction constant of a given reaction
        (for both the forward and backward reactions).
        The ``reaction_id`` which is assigned to a reaction
        depends on the order in which :meth:`add_reaction` was called.
        The 0th reaction has ``reaction_id=0``, the next added
        reaction needs to be addressed with ``reaction_id=1``, etc.

        Parameters
        ----------
        reaction_id : :obj:`int`
            Reaction id
        gamma : :obj:`float`
            New reaction constant

    delete_reaction()
        Delete a reaction from the set of used reactions
        (the forward and backward reaction).
        The ``reaction_id`` which is assigned to a reaction
        depends on the order in which :meth:`add_reaction` was called.
        The 0th reaction has ``reaction_id=0``, the next added
        reaction needs to be addressed with ``reaction_id=1``, etc.
        After the deletion of a reaction subsequent reactions
        take the ``reaction_id`` of the deleted reaction.

        Parameters
        ----------
        reaction_id : :obj:`int`
            Reaction id
