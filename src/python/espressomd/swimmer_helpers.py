def add_dipole_particle(system, particle, dipole_length,

    """
    Add a virtual particle pointing opposite of the swimmer particle
    either in front of (mode="puller") or behind (mode="pusher") the swimmer.
    The virtual particle is set up to exert the swimming force of the swimmer
    particle on a fluid in the opposite direction.

    Parameters
    ----------
    system : :obj:`~espressomd.system.System`
        The system that the particle belongs to.
    particle : :obj:`~espressomd.particle_data.ParticleHandle`
        The swimmer particle that will be paired with the virtual dipole particle.
        Must have the ``swimming`` attribute already set up to get the correct
        value for ``f_swim``.
    dipole_length : :obj:`float`
        The distance between the swimmer and the virtual dipole particle.
    dipole_particle_type : :obj:`int`
        The type of the virtual dipole particle.
    mode : :obj:`str`
        Allowed values: "pusher" (default) and "puller".
        Determines whether the virtual dipole particle
        will be placed in front of or behind the swimmer.

    Returns
    -------
    dipole_particle : :obj:`~espressomd.particle_data.ParticleHandle`
        The newly created particle.
