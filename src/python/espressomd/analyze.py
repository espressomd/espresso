def autocorrelation(time_series):
    """
    Calculate the unnormalized autocorrelation function :math:`R_{XX}`
    of an observable :math:`X` measured at time :math:`t` with constant
    time step for lag times :math:`\\tau` such that:

    :math:`\\displaystyle R_{XX}(\\tau) = \\frac{1}{N - \\tau} \\sum_{t=0}^{N - \\tau} X_{t} \\cdot X_{t + \\tau}`

    This is a scipy implementation of the algorithm described
    in :cite:`debuyl18a` that uses FFT. This implementation:

    - doesn't subtract the mean of the time series before calculating the ACF,
    - doesn't normalize the ACF by the variance of the time series,
    - assumes the time series is aperiodic (i.e. uses zero-padding).

    Parameters
    ----------
    time_series : (N,) or (N, M) array_like of :obj:`float`
        Time series to correlate. For multi-dimensional data, M is the
        number of columns.

    Returns
    -------
    (N,) array_like of :obj:`float`

    Methods

    linear_momentum()
        Calculates the system's linear momentum.

        Parameters
        ----------
        include_particles : :obj:`bool`, optional
            Whether to include the particles contribution to the linear
            momentum. True by default.
        include_lbfluid : :obj:`bool`, optional

            The linear momentum of the system.

    center_of_mass()

        Parameters
        ----------
        p_type : :obj:`int`
            Particle :attr:`~espressomd.particle_data.ParticleHandle.type`

        :obj: `dict`
            A dictionary where each item is a pair of a particle id and
            its respective neighboring particle ids.

    calc_re()
        Calculate the mean end-to-end distance of chains and its
        standard deviation, as well as mean square end-to-end distance of
        chains and its standard deviation.

        This requires that a set of chains of equal length which start
        with the particle number ``chain_start`` and are consecutively
        numbered, the last particle in that topology having id number
        ``chain_start + number_of_chains * chain_length - 1``.

        Parameters
        ----------
        chain_start : :obj:`int`

            Where [0] is the mean end-to-end distance of chains and [1] its
            standard deviation, [2] the mean square end-to-end distance and
            [3] its standard deviation.

    calc_rg()
        Calculate the mean radius of gyration of chains and its standard
        deviation, as well as the mean square radius of gyration of chains
        and its standard deviation.

        This requires that a set of chains of equal length which start
        with the particle number ``chain_start`` and are consecutively
        numbered, the last particle in that topology having id number
        ``chain_start + number_of_chains * chain_length - 1``.

        The radius of gyration is the radius of a sphere which would have
        the same moment of inertia as a polymer, and is defined as

        .. math::

           R_{\\mathrm G}^2 = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{N} \\left(\\vec r_i - \\vec r_{\\mathrm{cm}}\\right)^2\\,,

        where :math:`\\vec r_i` are position vectors of individual particles
        constituting the polymer and :math:`\\vec r_{\\mathrm{cm}}` is the
        position of its center of mass. The sum runs over all :math:`N`
        particles comprising the polymer. For more information see any
        polymer science book, e.g.Â :cite:`rubinstein03a`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        chain_start : :obj:`int`
            The id of the first monomer of the first chain.
        number_of_chains : :obj:`int`
            Number of chains contained in the range.
        chain_length : :obj:`int`
            The length of every chain.

        Returns
        -------
        (4,) array_like of :obj:`float`
            Where [0] is the mean radius of gyration of the chains and [1] its
            standard deviation, [2] the mean square radius of gyration and [3]
            its standard deviation.

    calc_rh()
        Calculate the mean hydrodynamic radius of chains and its standard
        deviation.

        This requires that a set of chains of equal length which start
        with the particle number ``chain_start`` and are consecutively
        numbered, the last particle in that topology having id number
        ``chain_start + number_of_chains * chain_length - 1``.

        The following formula is used for the calculation:

        .. math::

           \\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm H}} = \\frac{2}{N(N-1)} \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{N} \\sum\\limits_{j<i}^{N} \\frac{1}{|\\vec r_i - \\vec r_j|}\\,,

        This formula is only valid under certain assumptions. For more
        information, see chapter 4 and equation 4.102 inÂ :cite:`doi86a`.
        Note that the hydrodynamic radius is sometimes defined in a similar
        fashion but with a denominator of :math:`N^2` instead of :math:`N(N-1)`
        in the prefactor. Both versions are equivalent in the
        :math:`N\\rightarrow \\infty` limit but give numerically different
        values for finite polymers.

        Parameters
        ----------
        chain_start : :obj:`int`
            The id of the first monomer of the first chain
        number_of_chains : :obj:`int`
            Number of chains contained in the range.
        chain_length : :obj:`int`
            The length of every chain.

        Returns
        -------
        (2,) array_like of :obj:`float`:
            Where [0] is the mean hydrodynamic radius of the chains
            and [1] its standard deviation.

    angular_momentum()
        Calculate the system's angular momentum with respect to the origin.

        Note that virtual sites are not included, as they do not have a
        meaningful mass.

        Parameters
        ----------
        p_type : :obj:`int`
            Particle :attr:`~espressomd.particle_data.ParticleHandle.type` for
            which to calculate the center of mass, or ``-1`` for all particles.

        Returns
        -------
        (3,) array_like of :obj:`float`
           The center of mass of the system.

    structure_factor()
        Calculate the structure factor for given types.  Returns the
        spherically averaged structure factor of particles specified in
        ``sf_types``.  The structure factor is calculated for all possible wave
        vectors q up to ``sf_order``. Do not choose parameter ``sf_order`` too
        large because the number of calculations grows as ``sf_order`` to the
        third power.

        Parameters
        ----------
        sf_types : list of :obj:`int`
            Particle :attr:`~espressomd.particle_data.ParticleHandle.type`
            which should be considered.
        sf_order : :obj:`int`
            Specifies the maximum wavevector.

        Returns
        -------
        :obj:`ndarray`
            Where [0] contains the wave vectors q
            and [1] contains the structure factors S(q)

    distribution()
        Calculates the distance distribution of particles (probability of
        finding a particle of type A at a certain distance around a particle of
        type B, disregarding the fact that a spherical shell of a larger radius
        covers a larger volume). The distance is defined as the minimal distance
        between a particle of group ``type_list_a`` to any of the group
        ``type_list_b``. Returns two arrays, the bins and the (normalized)
        distribution.

        Parameters
        ----------
        type_list_a : list of :obj:`int`
            List of particle :attr:`~espressomd.particle_data.ParticleHandle.type`,
            only consider distances from these types.
        type_list_b : list of :obj:`int`
            List of particle :attr:`~espressomd.particle_data.ParticleHandle.type`,
            only consider distances to these types.
        r_min : :obj:`float`
            Minimum distance. Default is 0.
        r_max : :obj:`float`
            Maximum distance. By default, it is half the box size.
            A value larger than half the box size is allowed for systems
            with :ref:`open boundary conditions <Open boundaries>`.
        r_bins : :obj:`int`
            Number of bins. Default is 100.
        log_flag : :obj:`bool`
            When set to ``False``, the bins are linearly equidistant; when set
            to ``True``, the bins are logarithmically equidistant.
        int_flag : :obj:`bool`
            When set to ``True``, the result is an integrated distribution.

        Returns
        -------
        :obj:`ndarray`
            Where [0] contains the midpoints of the bins,
            and [1] contains the values of the rdf.

    potential_energy()
        Calculate the potential energy of the system, i.e. the total energy
        minus the kinetic energy.

        Returns
        -------
