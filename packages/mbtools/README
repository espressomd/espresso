mbtools is a collection of tcl packages designed to perform certain
common tasks in the simulation of bilayer membranes such as
preconstructing vesicles with certain geometries or calculating common
observables.  

In the examples directory you will find a set of simulations ranging
from basic to more complicated systems.  In all examples the membrane
model that is used is the solvent free model of "Cooke, Kremer and
Deserno" which makes use of broad attractive tail potentials.

######## Versions #################
###################################

9-9-05: Complete reorganisation of all packages.  All packages are now version 1.0.0

19-4-05: system_generation changed to version 0.1.0 and is
         incompatible with previous versions

# Installation and configuration ###
####################################

If all goes well Espresso should know where this package is.  If not
then you can set the environment variable ESPRESSO_PACKAGES to the
full path of the packages directory within mbtools

To test that everything works try running a script in the examples directory eg.

cd examples

$ESPRESSO_SOURCE/$PLATFORM/Espresso ./scripts/main.tcl simplebilayer.tcl

Much more help can be found in the doc directory

####################################
# Messages interface             ###
####################################

All of the packages in mbtools print messages through the package
mmsg.  The idea of this is to try and obtain some consistency in the
style and format of messages and some control over what is printed.
There are four types of messages (send, warn, err , debug).  To write
a standard message for instance just use ::mmsg::send [namespace
current] "text string".  The [namespace current] gives the current
namespace to mmsg where it is checked to see that messages from that
namespace are allowed.  By setting which namespaces are allowed you
can have some broad control over messages.  

In order to configure the allowed namespaces for messaging you should
add a line to your .espressorc file such as

set message_allowlist { :: ::system_generation ::setup_utilities ::std_analysis }
 which in this case will allow messaging from all packages.  To turn messaging off simply make an empty list like 
set message_allowlist { }
