<h2>What can you do with mbtools ? </h2>

<h3>Set up initial configurations</h3>

<p> One of the main features of mbtools is the ability to easily
create initial lipid configurations with interesting geometries.
These include flat membranes; </p>

<p>cylinders;</p>

<p><img src="cylinder_membrane.jpg"></p>

spheres;

toroids;

<p><img src="torus_membrane.jpg"></p>

and randomly distributed gases.</p>

<p> Each of these shapes is referred to as a geometry and any number
of geometries can be combined in a single simulation.  Once the
geometry has been chosen the user specifies the molecules which should
be placed in this geometry.  For example one could choose sphere as a
geometry and then define two different lipids and/or a protein to be
placed on the sphere.  Within reason (eg size restrictions) it should
be possible to use any mixture of known molecule types on any
geometry.  The molecule types available at present include proteins; </p>

<p>lipids of any length, and spherical colloids</p>

<h3>Perform standard simulation tasks</h3>

<p> mbtools includes several miscellaneous utility proceedures for
performing tasks such as warmup, setting tabulated interactions,
designating molecules to be trapped and a variety of topology related
sorting or data analysis functions</p>

<h3>Membrane specific analysis proceedures</h3>

<p>The analysis part of the mbtools package is designed to wrap
together all the analysis for a simulation into a single simple
interface.  At the beginning of the simulation the user specifies
which analyses should be performed by appending its name and arguments
to a variable, <em>analysis_flags</em>.  After the analysis is setup
one can then simply call <em>do_analysis</em> to perform all the
specified proceedures.  Analysis will store a data value each
time <em>do_analysis</em> is called. Then when a call
to <em>print_averages</em> is made the average of all stored values is
printed to a file and the store of values is reset to nil.  </p>

<p> Several membrane specific analysis proceedures have been included
with mbtools.  These include a fluctuation analysis which calculates
the membrane stiffness based on the distribution of bending
modes. Another cool analysis proceedure is the radial_density_map
which calculates the density of each bead type assuming cylindrical
symmetry of the system (see pic below).</p>
