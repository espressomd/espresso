<h2 class=center > mbtools system_generation </h2>

<div class = overview> 

  This package provides routines for placing molecules into specified
  geometries at the beginning of a simulation.  This document
  describes first describes the <a href="#basicui">user interface routines</a> for setting up
  the system and then goes on to give a list of all <a href="#geoms">possible geometric
  shapes</a> and <a href="#moltypes">possible molecule types</a>.  A programmers guide describing
  <a href="#newgeom">how to add a new geometry</a> or a <a href = "#newmol">new molecule type</a> are given at the
  end.

</div>

<h3><a name = basicui>Basic Commands</a></h3>

<ul class = commands > 

  <li>  <em class=cmd> ::mbtools::system_generation::setup_system </em> : <em class=args> [system_specs] [iboxl] [moltypes] </em>
    <div class = body >
	<ul class = arguments > 
	  <li> <em class=args> system_specs </em> This is a list of
	    structures called system specifications.  Each such system
	    specification in turn should be a list consisting of a
	    geometry and a list detailing the number of each molecule
	    type ie; 
	    <pre><code><p> set system_spec { geometry n_molslist } </p></code></pre> 

	    The <em class=cd> geometry </em> should be specified as a
	    list with two elements.  The first element should be a
	    string "geometry" identifying this list as a geometry.
	    The second element is a string containing the name of a
	    geometry type <em class=cd>mygeometry</em> followed by
	    arguments to be passed to the routine <em
	    class=cd>create_mygeometry</em>.

	    <p> The <em class=cd> n_molslist </em> should be specified
	    as a list with two elements.  The first element should be
	    a string "n_molslist" identifying this list as an
	    n_molslist.  The second element is a list each element of
	    which specifies a molecule type and the number of such
	    molecules.</p>
	  </li>
	  <li> <em class=args> boxl </em> A list containing the lengths of each of the box side lengths </li>
	  <li> <em class=args> moltypes </em> A list, each element of
	    which specifies a molecule type and type information.  The
	    exact format and requirements of this list are detailed
	    for each molecule separately (see below for a list of
	    molecule types and their requirements) however regardless
	    of mol type the first two elements of the list must be
	    a <em class=cd>moltypeid</em> and a string specifying the
	    moltype respectively.
	  </li>
	</ul>
	Sets up the system including generating topologies and placing
	molecules into specified geometries.  Each geometry and list
	of molecules to be placed into that geometry are grouped into
	a system spec.

	<h4> Example: </h4> The following code sets out the molecule
	types to be used in the simulation by setting a list
	called <em class=cd>moltypes</em>.  In this case two different
	lipid types are setup and assigned to moltypeids 0 and 1
	respectively.  Moltype 0 will consist of three beads per
	lipid, the first of which is of atomtype 0 and the second and
	third of which are of atomtype 1.  Bonds in the lipid will be
	of type 0 and 1 respectively.(see the <em
	class=cd>::mbtools::system_generation::place_lipid_linear </em>
	function for further details).
	<pre>
	  <code> 
	    set moltypes [list { 0 lipid { 0 1 1 } { 0 1 } } { 1 lipid { 0 2 2 2 } { 0 2 } } ]
	  </code>
	</pre>
	We then construct system specs for a flat bilayer and a
	spherical bilayer and group these into a <em class=cd>system_specs</em> list

	<p> First the spherical <em class=cd>system_spec</em> </p>
	<pre>
	  <code> 
	    set geometry { geometry  "sphere -shuffle -c \{ 0.0 0.0 15.0 \} " }
	    set n_molslist { n_molslist {  { 0 1000 } } }
	    lappend spherespec $geometry
	    lappend spherespec $n_molslist
	  </code>
	</pre>

	<p> The flat <em class=cd>system_spec</em> </p>
	<pre>
	  <code>
	    set geometry { geometry "flat -fixz" }
	    set n_molslist { n_molslist {  { 1 3000 } } }
	    lappend bilayerspec $geometry
	    lappend bilayerspec $n_molslist
	  </code>
	</pre>
	<p> Now group together the system_specs into a master list </p>
	<pre>
	  <code>
	    lappend system_specs $spherespec
	    lappend system_specs $bilayerspec
	  </code>
	</pre>
	<p> Make the call to <em class=cd>setup_system</em>
	<pre>
	  <code>
	    ::mbtools::system_generation::setup_system $system_specs [setmd box_l] $moltypes
	</code>
	</pre>
    </div>  
  </li>
  <li> <em class=cmd>
    ::mbtools::system_generation::get_trappedmols </em> : returns
    the internal list variable <em class=cd> trappedmols </em>
    which keeps track of all molecules that have been trapped by their center of mass. This function should be called after setup and would then typically be passed to the function <em class=cd>::mbtools::utils:trap_mols</em>.
  </li>
  <li> <em class=cmd>
    ::mbtools::system_generation::get_userfixedparts </em> : returns
    the internal list variable <em class=cd> userfixedparts </em>
    which keeps track of all particles that have been fixed in
    position during the setup.  This is useful for later releasing
    particles after warmup routines have been completed.

    <div class = synopsis >
      Creates a sphere of beads arranged such that they have an
      approximate spacing of <em class=cd> bondl </em> and such that
      they optimally cover the sphere. The optimal covering is
      obtained using the icover routines which are copyright
      <a href="http://www.research.att.com/~njas/"> R. H. Hardin,
      N. J. A. Sloane and W. D. Smith, 1994, 2000.</a>  Thus the
      routine will only work if you have installed icover and if you
      can successfully run it from the command line in the directory
      that you started your espresso job.  These routines are serious
      overkill so if anybody can think of a nice simple algorithm for
      generating a covering of the sphere let me know.

<h3> Programming Guide </h3>

<ul>
  <li> <h4><a name = newgeom> Adding a create routine </a></h4> To create a routine for
    setting up a system with a new type of geometry 
    <em class=cd>mygeom </em>.  Start by creating a new file <em class=cd> mygeom.tcl </em> inside the 
    <em class=cd>system_generation</em> directory.  
    The new file should
    declare a new namespace <em class=cd>mygeom</em> as a sub namespace
    of <em class=cd>::mbtools::system_generation</em> and export the
    proceedure <em class=cd>create_mygeom</em>.  Thus your <em class=cd>mygeom.tcl</em> file should begin with the lines;
    <pre><code>
	namespace eval ::mbtools::system_generation::mygeom {
	   namespace export create_mygeom
	}
    </pre></code> 
    
    Import your new file into the system_generation
    package by adding a line like the following to the <em>
    system_generation.tcl </em> file.
    
    <pre><code>
	source [file join [file dirname [info script]] mygeom.tcl]
    </pre></code>

    You then  need to implement the <em class=cd>create_mygeom</em> proceedure within your new namespace as follows;
    <div class = body> 
      <ul class = commands > 
	<li> <em class = cd> ::mbtools::system_generation::mygeom::create_mygeom { args } </em> </li>
      </ul>
    </div>  
  </li>
  <li> <h4><a name=newmol> Adding a molecule type </a></h4> To add a new molecule type
    you need to define a proceedure which determines how the atoms that
    make up the molecule should be placed.  This proc will live directly
    in the <em class=cd> ::mbtools::system_generation</em> namespace.
    Examples can be found in <em class=cd>place.tcl</em>. 
    
    <p> In order to register your new molecule type to allow placement
    in any geometry you need to add a call to it in the function <em
    class=cd> ::mbtools::system_generation::placemol</em>.  Make sure
    that all arguments to your <em class=cd>place_mymolecule</em>
    routine are included in this function call.  </p>

</ul>
</body>
