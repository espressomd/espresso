<title> mbtools Installation Guide</title>
<body>

<h2 class=center > Getting Started</h2>

<div class = body> 

  <p class= med> Since mbtools is provided as part of the espresso
  molecular dynamics simulation package you will need to download and
  install Espresso before you can use it.  Espresso can be downloaded
  free from <a href="http://espressomd.org">http://espressomd.org</a>.</p>

  <p class=med> 

    Once you have installed espresso you can find mbtools by looking
    inside the <em class=cd> packages</em> subdirectory.  Inside the
    <em class=cd>packages/mbtools</em> directory you will see a
    directory for each of the mbtools subpackages as well as an <em
    class=cd> examples</em> directory.  All of the examples scripts
    should work out of the box except those involving colloids which
    require you to install icover.sh (see documentation for hollowsphere molecule type).  To run the simplebilayer example
    cd to the examples directory and then type:
    <pre><code>
	$ESPRESSO_SOURCE/$PLATFORM/Espresso scripts/main.tcl simplebilayer.tcl
    </pre></code> 

    The first part of this command is simply the full path to the
    appropriate espresso executable on your machine.  Obviously you
    will need to have the <em class=cd>$ESPRESSO_SOURCE</em> and <em
    class=cd>$PLATFORM</em> environment variables set for it to work.
    After this executable the relative paths to two tcl scripts are
    given.  The first of these <em>main.tcl</em> is given as an
    argument to espresso and is therefore interpreted first by the
    espresso tcl interpreter.  The second tcl
    script <em>simplebilayer.tcl</em> is in turn passed as an argument
    to <em>main.tcl</em>.  
  </p>
  <p> Why separate the tcl commands into two files ? </p>

  This is really a matter of preference but if we keep all of the key
  commands and complex coding in a single file <em>main.tcl</em> and
  delegate simple parameter setting to a separate file it tends to be
  much easier to manage large numbers of jobs with regularly changing
  requirements.  Regardless of your personal preferences, the
  important point to note is that all of the important commands are
  contained in <em>main.tcl</em> and you should probably start there
  to get an understanding for how mbtools works.

  </p>

    Running the simplebilayer example should produce a directory
    called <em class=cd>simplebilayer</em> which contains the output
    from your simulation.  To view the results cd to the simplebilayer
    directory and look at the contents.  The directory contains many
    files including; 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li> The configurations generated during warmup : <em
							 class=cd>warm.*.gz</em></li>
    <li>pdb files corresponding to warmup
      configurations : <em class=cd>warm.vmd*.gz</em> </li>      
    <li> The configurations generated during the main run : <em class=cd>simplebilayer.*.gz</em></li>
    <li>pdb files corresponding to main run configs : <em class=cd>simplebilayer.vmd*.gz</em> </li>
    <li>The most recently generated checkpoint file : <em class=cd>checkpoint.latest.gz</em> </li>
    <li>A directory containing the second most recent checkpoint file : <em class=cd>checkpoint_bak</em> </li>
    <li>A file containing the topology of the system : <em class=cd>simplebilayer.top</em> </li>
    <li>The original parameter file with which you ran the simulation : <em class=cd>simplebilayer.tcl</em> </li>
    <li>A original parameter file with which you ran the simulation : <em class=cd>simplebilayer.tcl</em> </li>
    <li>Files containing analysis output for example : <em class=cd>time_vs_boxl_tmp</em> </li>
    <li>Force and energy tables : <em class=cd>*.tab</em> </li>
    <li>VMD script for visualising the warmup : <em class=cd>warm_animation.script</em> </li>
    <li>VMD script for visualising the main trajectory : <em class=cd>vmd_animation.script</em> </li>
  </ul>
  <p class=med> To visualise your results using the vmd scripts you
  need to make sure that you have vmd installed properly and that you
  have the special vmd procedures used by the espresso team (ie
  support for the loadseries command). Then you can visualise by
  typing; </p>
  <pre><code>
      vmd -e vmd_animation.script
  </pre></code>
