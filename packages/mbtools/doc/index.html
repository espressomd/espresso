<h3> What is mbtools ? </h3>

<p> mbtools is a set of tcl packages for setting up, analyzing and
running simulations of lipid membrane systems.  <a
href="./overview.html"> This page gives a more detailed overview of the
features of mbtools. </a> </p>

<p>All of the pure number
crunching required by mbtools is performed by the Espresso package
which is a rather full featured and highly extensible program for
molecular dynamics simulations.  Espresso is developed and maintained
by members of Christian Holm's group at the MPIP.  You can
download the package <a href= "http://espressomd.org">here</a>.</p>

<p> mbtools comes with a basic set of tabulated forces and potentials
for lipid interactions and some example scripts to help explain the
syntax of the commands.  If you make use of mbtools or of these
potentials please acknowledge us with a citation to: </p>

</ul>

<h3> How do I get it ? </h3>
Simply obtain the latest version of the <a href="http://espressomd.org"> Espresso package </a> which includes mbtools.

<h3> Help and documentation </h3> 

The <a href="./manual.html"> manual and programmers guide to
  mbtools </a> is now fairly complete.  The best approach to getting
started is probably to use this as a reference while experimenting
with scripts in the examples directory.


<h3> Acknowledgments </h3> 

Thanks go to Gregoria Illya and Vagelis Harmandaris who have
implemented many useful features of the package.
