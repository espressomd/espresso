<h2 class=center > mbtools Analysis </h2>

<div class = overview> 

  The analysis package is designed to help organise the many possible
  analysis routines that can be performed during a simulation.  This
  documentation describes the <a href="#basic">basic user interface commands</a> and then
  all of the <a href="#available">possible analysis routines</a>.  Instructions on <a href="#analysispguide">how to add a
  new analysis routine</a> are given at the end of this document.

</div>


<h3><a name=basic>Basic Commands</a></h3>

<div class = overview>
  The following commands comprise the user interface to the analysis package.

  <p> At the start of a simulation all of the analysis that is to be
  performed is specified using the <em class=cd> setup_analysis</em>
  command.  Each time you want the analysis performed a call to <em
  class=cd> do_analysis</em> should be made.  One can then call <em
  class=cd> print_averages </em> to write results to file.</p>
</div>

<ul class = commands >

  <li>  <em class=cmd> ::mbtools::analysis::setup_analysis </em> : <em class=args> -outputdir.arg -suffix.arg -iotype.arg -g.arg -str.arg </em>
    <div class = body >
	<ul class = arguments > 
	  <li> <em class=args> commands [./] </em> A tcl list where each element of the list is a string specifying the name and complete argument list for a particular analysis to be carried out. </li>
	  <li> <em class=args> outputdir [./] </em> The directory where analysis output files will be created </li>
	  <li> <em class=args> suffix [tmp] </em> Suffix that will be appended to standard file names for analysis output </li>
	  <li> <em class=args> iotype [a] </em> The iotype that will be used when opening files for analysis. For an explanation of the different iotypes see the documentation for the standard tcl command <em class = cd > open </em> </li>
	  <li> <em class=args> g [8]</em>Number of grid points per side with which to divide the bilayer for height profile analyses </li>
	  <li> <em class=args> str [4.0] </em>Distance of a tail bead from bilayer midplane beyond which a lipid is deemed to be a stray lipid. </li>
	</ul>
    </div>
    <div class=synopsis>
      Sets up the analysis package for a simulation run or analysis run that is about to be performed. This routine needs to be called before any analysis can be performed.
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>  <em class=cmd> ::mbtools::analysis::do_analysis </em> : 
    <ul class = arguments>
    </ul> Calls all of the <em class =  cd>  analyze </em> routines corresponding to commands setup in <em class =  cd> setup_analysis </em>
    <div class = body >
      <h4> Example: </h4> 
      <em class = cd> do_analysis </em> should be called only after <em class = cd> setup_analysis </em> has already been called.  After that one simply uses;
      <pre><code>
	  ::mbtools::analysis::do_analysis 
	  </code></pre>
    </div>
  </li>

  <li>  <em class=cmd> ::mbtools::analysis::reset_averages </em> : 
    <ul class = arguments>
    </ul>
Calls all of the <em class = cd > resetav </em> routines corresponding to commands setup in <em class =  cd> setup_analysis </em>.  These routines vary from command to command but they typically reset the storage and counter variables used for analysis results.
    <div class = body >
      <em class = cd> reset_averages </em> is typically only called internally by <em class = cd> print_averages </em>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>  <em class=cmd> ::mbtools::analysis::print_averages </em> : 
    <ul class = arguments>
    </ul>
    Calls all of the <em class = cd > printav </em> routines
    corresponding to commands setup in <em class = cd>
    setup_analysis </em>.  These routines typically print results to a
    file buffer.  After printing the <em class = cd >
    reset_averages </em> routine is called internally
    <div class = body >
      <h4> Example: </h4> 
      <em class = cd> print_averages </em> should be called only after <em class = cd> setup_analysis </em> has already been called.  After that one simply uses;
      <pre><code>
	  ::mbtools::analysis::print_averages 
	  </code></pre>
    </div>
  </li>

  <li>  <em class=cmd> boxl </em> : <em class=args> -verbose </em> : output || <em> time_vs_boxl </em>
    <div class = synopsis >
      Simply obtains the box dimensions from expresso </div>
  </li>
  <li>  <em class=cmd> clusters </em> : <em class=args> -alipid.arg -verbose </em> : output || <em> time_vs_clust, sizehisto.[format %05d $time] </em>
    <div class = body> 
      <ul class = arguments > 
	<li> <em class=args> alipid [1.29] </em> Value for the area

      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class = synopsis > 

      Calls the espresso command <em class=cd> analyze
	aggregation </em> which groups molecules in the system into
      aggregates.  Output to <em> time_vs_clust </em> is: maximum
      clusqqter size, minimum cluster size, average size of clusters
      including those of size 2 or greater ,standard deviation of
      clusters including those of size 2 or greater, number of clusters
      of size 2 or greater, total average cluster size, total cluster
      size std deviation, total number of clusters, length of the
      interface between clusters, standard deviation of the interface
      length, number of clusters for which length was calculate.
      
      <p> Additionally, at each call of <em class = cd>
	print_averages </em> the complete size histogram is printed to
	a file with the formatted name sizehisto.[format %05d $time]

  </li>
  <li>  <em class=cmd> density_profile </em> : <em class=args>  -nbins.arg -hrange.arg -beadtypes.arg  -colloidmoltypes.arg -r.arg -nogrid -verbose </em> : output || <em> av_zprof</em>
    <div class = body> 
      <ul class = arguments > 
	<li> <em class=args> nbins [100] </em> Number of slices into which the height range is divided for the purpose of calculating densities </li>
	<li> <em class=args> hrange [6] </em> The maximum vertical distance from the bilayer midplane for which to calculate densities. Note that the complete vertical range is therefore 2*hrange </li>
	<li> <em class=args> beadtypes [0] </em>  A tcl list of the bead types for which to calculate a density profile</li>
	<li> <em class=args> colloidmoltypes [] </em>  A tcl list of molecule types identifying the molecules which are colloids in the system. The default value is a null list </li>
	<li> <em class=args> r [0] </em>  A tcl list of sphere radii corresponding to the radii for each colloid type in the system. If this is non-zero the density profile will be calculated in spherical shells about the colloids in the system identified via <em class=cd > colloidmoltypes </em> or if <em class=cd > colloidmoltypes </em> is not set then the system center of mass is assumed for the colloid/vesicle center</li>
	<li> <em class=args> nogrid </em> If this is set a grid mesh will not be used to refine the density profile calculation by taking into account vertical differences between mesh points </li>

      Calculates the number density of each of the beadtypes given
      in <em class=cd > beadtypes </em> as a function of the vertical
      distance from the bilayer midplane. Lipids are also sorted
      according to their orientation and assigned to upper or lower
      leaflets accordingly.  Thus for a system with 3 beadtypes we
      would obtain 6 columns of output corresponding to <em class =
      cd> 0 (lower) 1 (lower) 2 (lower) 2 (upper) 1 (upper) 0
      (upper) </em> where the number refers to the bead type and upper
      or lower refers to the bilayer leaflet.

      get_lipid_orients </em> command of espresso and compares this
      with a reference set of lipid orients obtained at the start of
      the simulation with <em class=cd> setup_analysis </em>.  Based
      on this comparison the number of lipids which have flipped from
      their original positions is calculated </div>

      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class = synopsis >
      Routine for calculating the power spectrum of fluctuations for a
      flat bilayer sheet.  Uses the <em class = cd> modes_2d </em>
      routine in espresso to calculate the height function and perform
      the fft. See the documentation in the file <em>
	fluctuations.tcl </em> for detail on what is calculated and how to
      obtain a stiffness value from the resulting output.
      
      <p> Note that this routine causes a crash if it detects a large hole in the bilayer </p>

    </div>
    <div class = synopsis >
      For each lipid we calculate its 6 nearest neighbours and then
      calculate the height difference between the central lipid and
      these neighbours.  Taking these 6 values for each lipid we then
      create a histogram of number densities as a function of the
      height difference.

<h3><a name=analysispguide> Programming Guide</a> </h3>

<ul>
  <li> <h4> Adding a new analysis routine </h4> To add a new analysis
  routine you should create a new file called <em>
  myanalysis.tcl </em> which will contain all of your code.  At the
  top of this file you should declare a namespace for your analysis
    code and include all of the internal variables inside that namespace as follows; 
    <pre><code>
    namespace eval ::mbtools::analysis::myanalysis {
	variable av_myresult
	variable av_myresult_i
	variable f_tvsresult
	variable verbose
	
	namespace export setup_myanalysis
	namespace export analyze_myanalysis
	namespace export printav_myanalysis
	namespace export resetav_myanalisis
    }
    </pre></code>
    Import your new file into the analysis package by adding a line like the following to the <em> analysis.tcl </em> file. 
    <pre><code>
    source [file join [file dirname [info script]] myanalysis.tcl]
    </pre></code>

    You then  need to implement the following essential functions within your new namespace. 
    <div class = body> 
      <ul class = arguments > 
	<li> <em class = cd> ::mbtools::analysis::myanalysis::setup_myanalysis { args } </em> 
	  Typically you would use this function to initialise variables and open files.  Called by <em class = cd> ::mbtools::analysis::setup_analysis </em>.  Arguments are allowed.
	</li>
	<li> <em class = cd> ::mbtools::analysis::myanalysis::printav_myanalysis { void } </em> 
	 This function should print results to a file. Called by <em class = cd> ::mbtools::analysis::print_averages </em>.  Arguments are <b> not </b>allowed.
	</li>
	<li> <em class = cd> ::mbtools::analysis::myanalysis::analyze_myanalysis { void } </em> 
	  This function performs the actual analysis and should update the storage and averaging variables   Called by <em class = cd> ::mbtools::analysis::do_analysis </em>.  Arguments are <b> not </b> allowed.
	</li>
	<li> <em class = cd> ::mbtools::analysis::myanalysis::resetav_myanalysis { void } </em> 
	  This function should update averages and reset variables accordingly depending on your requirements.  Called by <em class = cd> ::mbtools::analysis::reset_averages </em>.  Arguments are <b> not </b> allowed.
	</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    If any of these functions is not implemented the program will
    probably crash.
