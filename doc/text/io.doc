/** \page io Using Checkpoints, saving configurations
The following procedures may be used to save/restore checkpoints to minimize the hassel involved when your simulations crashes after long runs.
The scripts are located in scripts/aux.tcl and use \ref tcl_blockfile as file format.
<ul>
    <li>\anchor checkpoint_set
        \verbatim checkpoint_set <destination> [<# of configs> [<tclvar> [<ia_flag>]]]\endverbatim
        creates a checkpoint with path/filename <destination> (compressed if <destination> ends with '<tt>.gz</tt>'), saving the last <# of configs> 
	which have been appended using \ref analyze_append (defaults to 'all'), adds all tcl-embedded variables specified in the tcl-list <tclvar>
	(defaults to '-') and all interactions unless <ia_flag> is set to '-'.<BR>
	It may be a good choice to use filenames such as '<tt>kremer_checkpoint.[eval format %05 $integration_step]</tt>' or 
	'<tt>kremer_checkpoint.029.gz</tt>' for <destination> because the command stores all the names of checkpoints set to a file derived from 
	<destination> by replacing the very last suffix plus maybe '.gz' with '.chk' (in the above examples: '<tt>kremer_checkpoint.chk</tt>') which
	is used by \ref checkpoint_read to restore all checkpoints.<BR>
	Although '<tt>checkpoint_set <destination></tt>' without the optional parameters will store a complete checkpoint sufficient for re-starting
	the simulation later on, you may run out of memory while trying to save a huge number of timesteps appended (\ref analyze_append). Hence one
	should rather only save those configurations <i>newly</i> added since the last checkpoint, i.e. if a checkpoint is created every 100,000 steps
	while a configuration is appended every 500 steps you may want to use '<tt>checkpoint_set <destination> 200</tt>' which saves the current
	configuration, all interactions, all bonds, and the last 200 entries appended to <tt>configs</tt> since the last checkpoint was created.
	Since \ref checkpoint_read reads in successively the checkpoints given in the '.chk'-file, the <tt>configs</tt>-array will nevertheless be 
	completely restored to its original state although each checkpoint-file contains only a fraction of the whole array.

    <li>\anchor checkpoint_read
        \verbatim checkpoint_read <origin>\endverbatim
	restores all the checkpoints whose filenames are listed in <origin> in the order given therein, consequently putting the simulation into
	the state it was in when \ref checkpoint_set was called. If parts of the <tt>configs</tt> array are given in the files listed in <origin>,
	it is assumed that they represent a fraction of the whole array.


    <li>\anchor tcl_polyBlockWrite 
	\verbatim polyBlockWrite <path> <param_list> <part_list>\endverbatim
	writes out the current 'Espresso' configuration as an AxA-blockfile, including parameters, interactions, particles, and bonds.<BR>
	<path> should contain the filename including the full path to it.<BR>
	<param_list> gives a tcl-list of the 'Espresso'-parameters (out of ) to be saved; if an empty list '{}' is supplied, no parameters are written. If 'all', <i>all</i> parameters available through \ref tcl_setmd are written. Defaults to the full parameter set.<BR>
	<part_list> gives a string of the particle-properties (out of pos | type | q | v | f) to be saved to disk; if an empty string ' "" 'is provided, no particles, no bonds, and no interactions are written. Defaults (if omitted) to all particle-properties.<BR>
	Depending on the file-name's suffix, the output will be compressed (if <path> ends with '.gz'), too.<BR>
	Note, that 'polyBlockWrite' in combination with \ref tcl_convertMD2Deserno replaces the (undocumented) function 'polywr': 
	To save the current configuration to a Deserno-compatible file (e.g. for use with 'poly2pdb') you may now use \ref #tcl_polyBlockWrite
	to save your current configuration to a blockfile, and convert that with \ref tcl_convertMD2Deserno afterwards,
	or you directly write a Deserno-compatible file by invoking
	\verbatim convertMD2Deserno "-1" <output-filename>\endverbatim
	out of 'Espresso' to save your current active configuration.<BR>
	However, this last paragraph now has only historical meaning (see \ref writepdb).

    <li>\anchor tcl_polyBlockWriteAll
        \verbatim polyBlockWriteAll <destination> [<tcl-var> [<rdm> [<configs>]]] \endverbatim
	does even more than \ref #tcl_polyBlockWrite, i.e. it saves <i>all</i> current interactions, particles, bonds, Espresso-variables to <destination>,
	but in addition it also saves the tcl-variables specified by <tcl-var> (if 'all', then all the variables in the active script are stored),
	it saves the state of the random number generator if <rdm> is 'random' (= complete state) or 'seed' (= only the seeds),
	and it saves all the particle configurations used for analysis purposes if <configs> is all but '-'.<BR>
	Using '-' as value usually skips that entry.<BR>
	With this one can set real checkpoints which should reproduce the script-state as precisely as possible.
</ul>
