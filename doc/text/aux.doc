/** \page aux Auxiliary Tcl functions
The following procedures are found in scripts/aux.tcl and scripts/countBonds.tcl. See \ref io for further functions as well.
<ul>
    <li>\anchor tcl_stopparticles
	\verbatim stopParticles 
 stop_particles \endverbatim
	halts all particles in the current simulation, setting their velocities and forces to zero. 
	The latter syntax does not provide feedback on the execution status.

    <li>\anchor tcl_countBonds
	\verbatim countBonds <particle_list>\endverbatim
	returns a tcl-list of the <i> complete </i> topology described by
	<particle_list>, which must have the same format as [part] (see 
	\ref tcl_part).<BR>
	The output list contains only particle_number and the
	corresponding bonding informations, thus it looks like e.g.
	\verbatim {106 {0 107}} {107 {0 106} {0 108}} {108 {0 107} {0 109}} ... {210 {0 209} {0 211}} {211 {0 210}} 212 213 ... \endverbatim
	for a single chain of 106 monomers between particle 106 and
	211, with additional loose particles 212, 213, ... (e.g. counter-ions). <BR>
	Note, that \ref tcl_part stores any bonds only with the
	particle of <i>lower</i> particle number, which is why [part 109] 
	would only return {... bonds {{0 110}}}, therefore not
	revealing the bond between particle 109 and (the preceding)
	particle 108, while <i>countBonds</i> would return <i>all</i>
	bonds particle 109 participates in.

    <li>\anchor tcl_findPropPos
	\verbatim findPropPos <particle_property_list> <property>\endverbatim
	returns the index of <property> within
	<particle_property_list>, which is expected to have the same
	format as [part <particle_number>]. If <property> is not
	found, -1 is returned.<BR>
	This function is useful to access certain properties of
	particles without hard-wiring their index-position, which
	might (again) change in future releases of \ref #part.
	\verbatim [lindex [part $i] [findPropPos [part $i] type]]\endverbatim
	for example returns the <particle_type> of particle $i without fixing
	where exactly that information has to be in the output of
	[part $i].
    <li>\anchor tcl_findBondPos
	\verbatim findBondPos <particle_property_list>\endverbatim
	returns the index of the bonds within
	<particle_property_list>, which is expected to have the same
	format as [part <particle_number>];<BR>
	hence its output is the	same as [findPropPos <particle_property_list> bonds].
	If the particle does not have any bonds, -1 is returned.

    <li>\anchor tcl_timeStamp
	\verbatim timeStamp <path> <prefix> <postfix> <suffix>\endverbatim
	modifies the filename contained within <path> to be preceded by
	a <prefix> and having a <postfix> before the <suffix>; e.g.
	\verbatim timeStamp ./scripts/config.gz DH863 001 gz\endverbatim
	returns './scripts/DH863_config001.gz'.<BR>
	If <postfix> is '-1' the current date is used in the format
	'\%y\%m\%d' thus leading to './scripts/DH863_config021022.gz' on
	October 22nd, 2002.
</ul>
