/** \page convertDeserno Conversion of Deserno files
The following procedures are found in scripts/convertDeserno.tcl.
<ul>
    <li>\anchor tcl_convertDeserno2MD
	\verbatim convertDeserno2MD <source_file> <destination_file>\endverbatim
	converts the particle configuration stored in \<source_file\>
	from Deserno-format into blockfile-format, importing everything
	to 'Espresso' and writing it to \<destination_file\>. 
	The full particle information, bonds, interactions, and parameters will be converted and saved.<BR>
	If \<destination_file\> is "-1", the data is only loaded into 'Espresso' and nothing is written to disk.<BR>
	If \<destination_file\> has the suffix '.gz', the output-file will be compressed.<BR>
	The script uses some assumptions, e.g. on the
	\<particle_type_number\>s of \ref tcl_part for polymers,
	counter-ions, or on <i>sigma, shift, offset</i> for
	Lennard-Jones-potentials (\ref tcl_inter; current defaults are 
	2.0, 0, 0, respectively); these are all set by
	\verbatim initConversion \endverbatim
	(which is automatically called by <i>convertDeserno2MD</i>)
	so have a look at the sourcecode of
	<i>'convertDeserno.tcl'</i> in the <i>"scripts"</i>-directory for a
	complete list of assumptions.<BR>
	However, if for some reasons different values need to be set,
	it is possible to bypass the initialization routine and/or
	override the default values, e.g. by explicitly executing
	<i>initConversion</i>, afterwards overwriting all variables
	which need to be re-set, and manually invoking the main
	conversion script
	\verbatim convertDeserno2MDmain <source_file> <destination_file> \endverbatim
	to complete the process.

    <li>\anchor tcl_convertMD2Deserno
	\verbatim convertMD2Deserno <source_file> <destination_file>\endverbatim
	converts the particle configuration stored in the 'Espresso'-blockfile \<source_file\> into a
	Deserno-compatible \<destination_file\>.<BR>
	If \<source_file\> is "-1", the data is entirely taken from 'Espresso' without loading anything from disk.<BR>
	If \<source_file\> has the suffix '.gz', it is assumed to be compressed; otherwise it will be treated as containing plain text.<BR>
	Since Deserno stores much more than 'Espresso' does due to a
	centralized vs. a local storage policy, it depends on correct
	values for the following properties, which therefore should be contained in \<source_file\>:
	<ol>
	<li> the \<particle_type_number\> used for polymers,
	counter-ions, and salt-molecules (defaults are: 
	<i>set type_P 0</i>, <i>set type_CI 1</i>, and <i>set type_S 2</i>
	<li> the \<bond_type_number\> used for FENE-interactions
	(default is: <i>set type_FENE 0</i>)
	</ol>
	As for <i>convertDeserno2MD</i>, the defaults are set upon
	initialization by
	\verbatim initConversion \endverbatim
	(which is automatically called by <i>convertMD2Deserno</i> as well),
	but may be overwritten the same way as explained for \ref
	tcl_convertDeserno2MD. However, parameters stored in \<source_file\> cannot (and will not) be overwritten,
	because they were part of the system originally saved and should not be altered initially.<BR>
	Note, that some entries in a Deserno-file cannot be determined 
	at all, these are by default set to
	\verbatim set prefix AA0000
 set postfix 0
 set seed -1
 set startTime -1
 set endTime -1
 set integrationSteps -1
 set saveResults -1
 set saveConfig -1
 set subbox_1D -1
 set ip -1
 set step -1 \endverbatim
	but of course may be overwritten as well after calling
	<i>initConversion</i> and before continuing with
	\verbatim convertMD2DesernoMain <source_file> <destination_file>\endverbatim
	the actual conversion process.<BR>
	The Deserno-format assumes knowledge of the topology, hence a respective analysis is conducted 
	to identify the type and structure of the polymer network.
	The script allows for randomly stored polymer solutions and
	melts, no matter how they're messed up; however, crosslinked
	networks need to be aligned to be recognized correctly, i.e.
	they must be set up consecutively, such that the first chain
	with $MPC monomers corresponds to the first $MPC particles in
	[part], the 2nd one to the $MPC following particles, etc. etc.

   <li> It is now possible to save the <i>whole</i> state of 'Espresso', including all parameters and interactions. 
        These scripts make use of that advantage by storing everything they find in the Deserno-file - but vice versa they also expect 
	you to provide a blockfile containing all possible informations.
</ul>
These conversion scripts have been tested with both polymer melts and
end-to-end-crosslinked networks in systems with or without
counterions. It should work with additional salt-molecules or neutral
networks as well, although that hasn't been tested yet - if you've
some of these systems in a Deserno-formated file, please submit them
for extensive analysis.
