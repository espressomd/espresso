\section introduction Introduction

Espresso is a MPI parallel molecular dynamics program. It uses a
<a href="http://tcl.activestate.com">Tcl</a> script for
controlling details of the simulation to allow great flexibility.
The standard Tcl language was extended by some commands which allow
to perform a complete MD simulation. Details on the additional Tcl commands
can be found \ref tcl "here".

The script is interpreted on only one node,
the master node. The other nodes wait for the master node to issue
specific actions, i. e. we utilize a client-server model. More details
can be found in \ref communication.h "communication.h". During the
actual integration however the communication is done synchronous.
For details see \ref integrate.c "integrate.c".

\section start Getting Started

<ol>
<li> Get your PEP membership.
<li> Add the following lines to your .cshrc file.
\verbatim 
##################################################################
# Settings for TCL_MD
##################################################################
if ( (`uname` == "Linux") ) then
    setenv PATH "${PATH}:.:/opt/lam/bin"
endif
# cvs root directory 
setenv CVSROOT ~pep/cvsroot
# TCL_MD source directory
setenv TCLMD_SOURCE  "your_directory/Espresso"
# TCL_MD script directory
setenv TCLMD_SCRIPTS "your_directory/Espresso/scripts"
\endverbatim
Replace your_directory by the directory where you want to install Espresso.
<li> Get your local copy with:
\verbatim cvs checkout Espresso \endverbatim
<li> Compile using 
\verbatim gmake \endverbatim
<li> Create actual documentation with (html, latex, man and rtf). This 
command works only on our Linux PCs (needs doxygen).
\verbatim gmake doc\endverbatim
(Use touch somefile.c if it does not work rightaway)
<li> Read the documentation carefully (Come on, there had been only 213 pages when I
was writing these lines) !!!
<li> Try the sample script files in testsuite directory: 
setup.tcl which sets up a new configuration using the ramp potential.
test.tcl Doing some MD on the new configuration. Try also the VMD
connection included (set use_imd y).
<li> Complain if you experience problems.
</ol>

\section restrictions Restrictions

<ul>
<li> The long range part is implemented for full periodicity, cubic
box and cubic mesh only. The program will probably crash if you mix up 
things here.
</ul>

\section bugs Bugs
