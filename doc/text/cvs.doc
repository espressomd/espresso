/** \page our_cvs How to use CVS

<b>Befor checking in any changes you should make sure that</b>
<ol>
<li> your file contains no conflicts with the cvs version.
<li> the code compiles without warning on Linux and OSF1.
<li> the not yet written maketest "test procedure" runs. 
<li> you have informed the responsible person of that file about major
changes.
</ol>

Here a list of the most common cvs commands we need:

<ul>
<li> \anchor cvs_add \verbatim cvs add <file> \endverbatim
	Adds \<file\> to the cvsroot directory. You have to use 
	\ref cvs_commit "commit" to make your add complete. 
<li> \anchor cvs_checkout \verbatim cvs checkout <project> \endverbatim
	This will create a new directory \<project\> in the CWD, containing an
	up-to-date version of \<project\>.
<li> \anchor cvs_commit \verbatim cvs commit <file> \endverbatim
	Puts your changes into the cvsroot directory and makes them
	available for the others. 
	<b>Use with care and write a senseful comment!!!</b>
<li> \anchor cvs_diff \verbatim cvs diff <file> \endverbatim
	Shows differences of your local copy of \<file\> with respect
	to the cvs version.	
<li> \anchor cvs_log \verbatim cvs log <file> \endverbatim
	Shows the log file for \<file\>, e. g. comments on changes that
	have been made in the past and who is responsible for them.
<li> \anchor cvs_remove \verbatim cvs remove <file> \endverbatim
	removes a file from the cvsroot directory. That means, it is
	still there and can be restored, but will not be contained in
	future checkouts and updates. <b>Use with care!!!</b><BR>
	For permanent deletion use \ref cvs_commit "commit" one final
	time on that file, adding e. g. 'removed.' as comment. <b>Use
	with even more care!!!</b>
<li> \anchor cvs_status \verbatim cvs status <file> \endverbatim
	Reports the status of your local copy of \<file\> with respect
	to the cvs version.	
<li> \anchor cvs_update \verbatim cvs update \endverbatim
	Get the current version of all files from the cvsroot
	directory. There will be a U in front of files that are
	updated, a M before files where cvs merges your local copy
	with the cvs version and a ? if there are files in your local
	directory which are not known to cvs. You will get a warning 
	\verbatim conflicts during merge \endverbatim for files where
	cvs is not able to merge. <b>You have to look at these files
	by hand!</b> They contain sections like
	\verbatim 
<<<<<<< init.tcl
Local version of the file (e. g. 'init.tcl')
as stored in your local directory
=======
CVS version of the file (e. g. release 1.5)
from the repository in the cvsroot directory
>>>>>>> 1.5
	\endverbatim
	You have to <b>think first</b> and then decide how to combine
	the two versions.
</ul>
