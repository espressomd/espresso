\section add_vars Adding global variables
	Global variables are the simplest way to communicate values between the Tcl script and
	the C simulation code.
	To make a C variable available to Tcl, declare the variable extern in a header file that
	you then include in global.c. Then add a new line to \ref #fields (for details on the
	entries see \ref Datafield). Basically you have to declare where the variable is stored,
	which type (INT or DOUBLE) it has and how many elements. A callback procedure can be
	given which checks if the given value is valid and stores it. It is also responsible for	
	dispatching the new value to the other nodes, if necessary. The easiest way to do that is by using
	\ref mpi_bcast_parameter, which will transfer the value to the other nodes. A simple example
	is \ref box_l with the callback procedure \ref boxl_callback. For \ref mpi_bcast_parameter
	to work, it is necessary that they occur in the \ref FIELD_BOXL "variables enumeration".
	So please keep this list in sync! Another list to keep up to date is the \ref desc_var.

\section add_bonded Adding new bonded interactions
	Every interaction resides in an own header file. A simple example for a bonded interaction
	is the FENE bond in \ref fene.h. The data structures, however, reside in \ref interaction_data.h.
	The bonded interactions are all stored in a union, \ref Bonded_ia_parameters. For a new interaction,
	just add another struct. Each bonded interaction is assigned a type number, which has the form BONDED_IA_*,
	e. g. \ref BONDED_IA_FENE. The new interaction also has to have such a <em>unique</em> number.
	
	After the setup of the necessary data structures in \ref interaction_data.h, write the header file,
	something like new_interaction.h. You may want to use fene.h as a template file.
	Typically, you will have the following procedures:
	<ul>
	<li>	\verbatim int *_set_params(int bond_type, \<parameters>\) \endverbatim
		this function is used to define the parameters for a bonded
		interaction. The bond_type is the bond type number from the inter command, and not one of the BONDED_*. It is
		rather an index to the \¶ef bonded_ia_params array. \ref make_bond_type_exist makes sure that all bond types
		up the given type exist and are preinitialized with BONDED_IA_NONE, i. e. are empty bond types. Therefore fill
		bonded_ia_params[bond_type] with the parameters of your interaction type. </li>
	<li>	\verbatim
		int calc_*_force(Particle *p1, Particle *p2,..., Bonded_ia_parameters *iaparams, double dx[3], double force[3],...)
		\endverbatim
		This routine calculate the force between the particles. ia_params represents the parameters to use for this bond,
		dx represents the vector pointing from particle 2 to particle 1.
		The force on particle 1 is placed in the force vector (and <em>not</em> added to it). The force on particle 2 is
		obtained from Newton's law. For many body interactions, just add more particles in the beginning, and return the
		forces on particles 1 to N-1. Again the force on particle N is obtained from Newton's law. The procedure should return
		0 except when the bond is broken, in which case 1 is returned. </li>
	<li>	\verbatim
		int *_energy(Particle *p1, Particle *p2, ..., Bonded_ia_parameters *iaparams, double dx[3], double *_energy)
		\endverbatim
		This calculates the energy originating from this bond. The result is placed in the location _energy points to,
		ia_params and dx are the same as for the force calculation, and the return value is also the flag for a broken bond.
		</li>
	</ul>

	After the preparation of the header file, the bonded interaction has to be linked with the rest of the code. In
	\ref interaction_data.c, most of the work has to be done:
	<ol>
	<li>	Add a name for the interaction to \ref get_name_of_bonded_ia. </li>
	<li>	In \ref calc_maximal_cutoff, add a case for the new interaction which makes sure that max_cut is larger
		than the interaction range of the new interaction, typically the bond length. This value is always used as calculated
		by \ref calc_maximal_cutoff, therefore it is not strictly necessary that the maximal interaction range is stored
		explicitly. </li>
	<li>	Add a print block for the new interaction to \ref printBondedIAToResult. The print format should be such
		that the output can be used as input to inter, and defines the same bond type. </li>
	<li>	in \ref inter_parse_bonded, add a parser for the parameters. See the \ref parsing section below. </li>
	</ol>
	Besides this, you have enter the force rsp. energy calculation routines in \ref add_bonded_force, \ref add_bonded_energy,
	\ref add_bonded_virials and \ref calc_p_tensor. The pressure occurs twice, once for the parallelized isotropic pressure and
	once for the tensorial pressure calculation. For pair forces, the pressure is calculated using the virials, for many body
	interactions currently no pressure is calculated.

	After the new bonded interaction works properly, it would be a good idea to add a testcase to the testsuite, so that changes
	breaking your interaction can be detected early.

\section add_nonbonded Adding new nonbonded interactions

	Writing nonbonded interactions is similar to writing nonbonded interactions. Again we start with \ref interaction_data.h, where
	the parameter structure has to be setup. Just add your parameters <em>with reasonable names</em> to \ref IA_parameters. Note that
	there must be a setting for the parameters which disables the interaction.

	Now write the header file for the interaction. This time ljcos.h may be a good example. The needed routines are
	<ul>
	<li>	\verbatim int print*IAToResult(Tcl_Interp *interp, int i, int j) \endverbatim
		writes out the interaction parameters between particles of type i and j to the interpreters result such that the result
		can be fed into the inter command again to obtain the same interaction. The \ref IA_parameters pointer can be obtained
		conveniently via \ref get_ia_param(i,j). </li>
	<li>	\verbatim
		int *_parser(Tcl_Interp * interp, int part_type_a, int part_type_b, int argc, char ** argv)
		\endverbatim
		parses the command line given by argc and argv for the parameters needed for the interaction, and writes them to the
		IA_parameters for types part_type_a and part_type_b. For details on writing the parser, see \ref parsing. The routine
		returns 0 on errors and otherwise the number of parameters that were read from the command line. </li>
	<li>	\verbatim
		void add_*_pair_force(Particle *p1, Particle *p2, IA_parameters *ia_params, double d[3], double dist2, double dist, double force[3])
		double *_pair_energy(Particle *p1, Particle *p2, IA_parameters *ia_params, double d[3], double dist2, double dist)
		\endverbatim
		are the force rsp. energy calculation routines. ia_params gives the interaction parameters for the particle types of
		particles p1 and p2, d gives the vector from particle 2 to particle 1, dist its length and dist2 its squared length. The last
		three parameters can be chosen on demand. Note that unlike in the bonded case, the force routine is called <em>add_*</em>, i. e.
		the force has to be <em>added</em> to force. The *_pair_energy routine simply returns the energy directly instead of the pointer approach
		of the bonded interactions. </li>
	</ul>

	Change \ref interaction_data.c as follows (most changes are pretty much the same for all potentials):
	<ol>
	<li> modify \ref initialize_ia_params and \ref copy_ia_params to take care of the additional parameters needed for your potential.
	<li> \ref checkIfParticlesInteract has to be modified to also check for the no interaction condition for the new interaction (typically zero cutoff).
	<li> \ref calc_maximal_cutoff has to modified such that max_cut is larger than the maximal cutoff your interaction needs. Again, the code always uses
		the result from this function, therefore the cutoff does not have to be stored explicitly in the interaction parameters.	
	<li> add your print*IAToResult routine to \ref printNonbondedIAToResult.
	<li> add the *_parser routine to \ref inter_parse_bonded.
	</ol>
	After this, add the force calculation to \ref add_non_bonded_pair_force, \ref add_non_bonded_pair_virials and \ref calc_p_tensor, and the energy calculation to
	\ref add_non_bonded_pair_energy. 

	After the new nonbonded interaction works properly, it would be a good idea to add a testcase to the testsuite, so that changes
	breaking your interaction can be detected early.

\section part_org Particle data organization

	The particle data organization is described in \ref tcl_cellsystem, its implementation is briefly described in \ref cells.h and
	\ref ghosts.h. Here only some details on how to access the data is assembled. Writing a new cellsystem almost always requires
	deep interactions with the most low level parts of the code and cannot be explained in detail here.

	Typically, one has to access all real particles stored on this node, or all ghosts. This is done via a loop similar to the
	following:
\verbatim
   Cell *cell;
   int c,i,np,cnt=0;
   Particle *part;
 
   for (c = 0; c < local_cells.n; c++) {
     cell = local_cells.cell[c];
     part = cell->part;
     np   = cell->n;
     for(i=0 ; i < np; i++) {
	do_something_with_particle(part[i]);
     }
   }
\endverbatim
	To access the ghosts instead of the real particles, use \ref ghost_cells instead of \ref local_cells.

	Another way to access particle data is via \ref local_particles. This array has as index the particle identity, so that local_particles[25]
	will give you an pointer to the particle with identity 25, or NULL, if the particle is not stored on this node, neither as ghost nor as
	real particle. Note that the local_particle array does not discriminate between ghosts and real particles. Its primary use is for the
	calculation of the bonded interactions, where it is used to efficiently determine the addresses of the bonding partner(s).

	The master node can add and remove particles via \ref place_particle and \ref remove_particle, or change properties via \ref
	set_particle_v etc. This is the preferred way to handle particles, since it is multiprocessor save.

	However, some algorithms, especially new cellsystems, may force you to operate locally on the particle data and shift them around manually.
	Since the particle organization is pretty complex, there are additional routines to move around particles between particle lists. The routines
	exist in two versions, one indexed, and one unindexed. The indexed version take care of the \ref local_particles array, which for each particle
	index tells where to find the particle on this node (or NULL if the particle is not stored on this node), while the unindexed versions require
	you to take care of that yourself (for example by calling \ref update_local_particles). The second way is much faster if you do a lot of particle
	shifting. To move particles locally from one cell to another, use \ref move_indexed_particle or \ref move_unindexed_particle, never try to change
	something directly in the lists, you will create a mess! Inserting particles locally is done via \ref append_indexed_particle or
	\ref append_unindexed_particle.

	Besides the \ref local_particles array, which has to be up to date at any time, there is a second array \ref particle_node, which is available on the
	master node only outside of the integrator, i. e. in the Tcl script evaluation phases. If particle_node is NULL, you have to call
	\ref build_particle_node to rebuild it. It contains for each particle identity the node the particle is currently located on.
	
	The proper cell for a particle is obtained via \ref CellStructure::position_to_node, which calculates for a given position the node it belongs to,
	and \ref CellStructure::position_to_cell, which calculates the cell it belongs to on this node, or NULL, if the cell is from a different node.
	However, you should normally not be bothered with this information, as long as you stick to \ref place_particle and the other routines to modify
	particle data.

	Writing a new cellsystem basically requires only to create the functions listed in \ref CellStructure. The init function has to also setup the communicators,
	which is the most complex part of writing a new cellsystem and contains all the communication details. \ref prepare_comm is a small wrapper for the most
	common operations. Otherwise just grep for CELL_STRUCTURE_DOMDEC, and add some appropriate code for your cell system. Note, however, that each cell system
	has its specific part of the code, where only this cellsystem does something strange and unique, so here you are completely on your own. Good luck.

\section errorhandling Errorhandling for developpers

    	Developers should use the errorhandling mechanism whenever it is possible to recover from an error such that
	continuing the simulation is possible once the source of the error is removed, i. e. the bond is removed or a
	parameter changed. For example, if due to excessive forces, particles have been far out of their current node,
	Espresso puts them into one of the local cells. Since the position is unphysical anyways, it is of no importance
	anymore, but now the user can place the particles anew and perhaps decrease the time step such that the simulation
	can continue without error. However, most often the recovery requires no special action.

    	To issue an background error, call errtxt=\ref runtime_error(length), where length should be the maximal length of the
    	error message (you can use TCL_DOUBLE_SPACE rsp. TCL_INTEGER_SPACE to obtain space for a double rsp. integer).
    	The function returns a pointer to the current end of the string in \ref error_msg. After doing so, you should use the 
	"ERROR_SPRINTF" - macro, which substitutes to a simple "sprintf", so that your errormessage will automatically be added
	to the "runtime_errors resolved"-page. Please make sure that you give each of your errors an unique 3-digit errorcode
	(for already used errorcodes have a look at the "runtime_errors resolved"-page), have the curled braces around your
	message and the space at the end, otherwise the final error message will look awful and will propably not automatically be
	added to our error-page. Typically, this looks like this:
    	\verbatim
    	if (some_error_code != OK) {
      	  char *errtxt = runtime_error(TCL_INTEGER_SPACE + 128);
      	  ERROR_SPRINTF(errtxt, "{error occured %d} ", some_error_code);
      	  recovery;
    	}
    	\endverbatim

    	If you have long loops during which runtime errors can occur, such as the integrator loop, you should call
    	\ref check_runtime_errors from time to time inbetween and exit the loop on errors. Note that this function requires
    	all nodes to call it synchronously.

    	In all cases, all Tcl commands should call \ref mpi_gather_runtime_errors before exiting. You simply handover the
    	result you were just about to return. If the result was TCL_ERROR, then \ref mpi_gather_runtime_errors will keep the
    	Tcl error message and eventually append the background errors. If the result was TCL_OK, i. e. your function did not
	find an error, the result will be reset (since Espresso is in an undefined state, the result is meaningless), and only
	the background errors are returned. Whenever a Tcl command returns, instead of "return TCL_OK/TCL_ERROR" you should use
	\verbatim return mpi_gather_runtime_errors(interp, TCL_OK/TCL_ERROR); \endverbatim

	For a full list of background-errors visit the \ref background_errors page

	\section add_other Adding other stuff
	Here you are mostly on your own. Contacting the original developers might \em really help.
	Nevertheless the next two sections contain some information you very likely will need.
	But keep in mind that Espresso is a parallel code; therefore the organization is more
	complicated as one thinks it has to be.
