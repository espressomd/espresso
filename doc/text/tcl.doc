of Tcl it offers the following commands, which are implemented in C and provide the
interface between the Tcl script and the MD code:
<ul>
  <li>\ref particle_setup "Setting up the particles"

	Most important commands: \ref tcl_part "part" .

\section tcl_procs Additional TCL-Procedures

At program start, Espresso reads in a starting script
<i>'init.tcl'</i>. It is assumed to be located in a directory
<i>"scripts"</i>, but this default value can be overridden by the
environment variable ESPRESSO_SCRIPTS.<BR>
It also includes some useful tcl-scripts (which should always be
located in the same directory <i>"scripts"</i>) providing additional
commands which are implemented in tcl and enhance the interface
between the tcl-script and the MD-code. For details on these procedures see
<ul>
<li> \ref convertDeserno
<li> \ref statistics
<li> \ref io
<li> \ref writepdb
<li> \ref math
<li> \ref aux
<li> \ref blade
</ul>

\section errors Errorhandling
	Errors in the parameters are detected as early as possible, and hopefully self explanatory error messages
	returned without any changes to the data in the internal data of Espresso. This include errors such as
	setting nonexistent properties of particles or simply misspelled commands. These errors are returned as
	standard Tcl errors and can be caught on the Tcl level via
	\verbatim catch {script} err \endverbatim
	When run noninteractively, Tcl will return a nice stack backtrace which allows to quickly find the line causing
	the error.

	However, some errors can only be detected after changing the internal structures, so that Espresso is left in
	a state such that integration is not possible without massive fixes by the users. Especially errors occuring
	on nodes other than the primary node fall under this condition, for example a broken bond or illegal parameter
	combinations.

	For error conditions such as the examples given above, an Tcl error message of the form
    	\verbatim <Tcl error> background 0 {<error a>} {<error b>} 1 {<error c>}\endverbatim
	is returned. Following possibly a normal Tcl error message, after the <em>background</em> keyword all severe errors
    	are listed node by node, preceeded by the node number.
    	a special error is "<consent>", which means that one of the slave nodes found exactly the same errors as
    	the master node. This happens mainly during the initialization of the integrate, e. g. if the time step
    	is not set. In this case the error message will be
    	\verbatim background_errors 0 {time_step not set} 1 <consent> \endverbatim

	In each case, the current action was not fulfilled, and possibly other parts of the internal data also had to be
	changed to allow Espresso to continue, so you should really know what you do if you try and catch these errors.
