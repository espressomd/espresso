/** \page tcl_imd IMD
IMD (Interactive Molecular Dynamics) is the protocol VMD uses to communicate
with a simulation. Tcl_md implements this protocol to allow online visual analysis
of running simulations.

In IMD, the simulation acts as a data server. That means that a simulation can provide
the possibility of connecting VMD, but VMD need not be connected all the time. You can
watch the simulation just from time to time.

In the following the setup up and using of IMD is described.


\section imd_script IMD in the script
In your simulation, the IMD connection is setup up using
\verbatim imd connect <port> \endverbatim
where <port> is an arbitrary port number (it has to be between 1024 and 65000). Normally
Espresso will try to open port 10000, but the port may be in use already by another Espresso
simulation. In that case it is a good idea to just try another port (see lj_liquid.tcl).

Now while the simulation is running, you should execute
\verbatim imd positions \endverbatim
from time to time, which will transfer the current coordinates to VMD, if it is connected.
If not, nothing happens and imd connect just consumes a small amount of CPU time.

\verbatim imd listen <seconds> \endverbatim
can be used to let the simulation wait for
<seconds> seconds or until IMD has connected. This is normally only useful in demo scripts,
if you want to see all frames of the simulation.

If your simulations terminates,
\verbatim imd disconnect \endverbatim
will terminate the IMD session. This is normally not only nice but also the operating system
will not free the port for some time, so that without disconnecting for some 10 seconds you
will not be able to reuse the port.

Additionally, you have to provide VMD with the structural information for your system. Therefore
your program has to write out psf-/pdb-files using \ref tcl_writepsf and \ref tcl_writepdb.

That hassle is greatly reduced by using the built-in auxiliary script
\anchor tcl_prepare_vmd
\verbatim prepare_vmd_connection [<filename> [<wait> [<start>]]] \endverbatim
which writes out the necessary psf-/pdb-files to <tt><filename>.psf</tt> and <tt><filename>.pdb</tt>
(default for <tt><filename</tt> is '<tt>vmd</tt>'), doing some nice stuff such as coloring the 
molecules, bonds and counterions appropriately, rotating your viewpoint, and connecting your system
to the visualization server. If <tt><start></tt> is 1 (the default), it does all that by itself; 
otherwise it writes those steps out to a script-file '<tt>vmd_start.script</tt> 
and waits for <tt><wait></tt> seconds (default: 0) for you to connect.


\section imd_vmd Using IMD in VMD
So after your simulation runs and has written the psf/pdb files, you start VMD.
Then click on "Molecule", choose fileformat "psf and pdb", and select your psf/pdb files in
the corresponding entries. Now click on "Load Molecule". You should see the snapshot you
saved in the psf/pdb files.

Then execute "imd connect <host> <port>", where <host> is the host running the simulation
and <port> is the port it listens to. <em> Note that VMD crashes, if you do that without
loading the molecule before </em>.
