  abstract = {We used Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the conformations
	of a star polyelectrolyte in poor solvent. We observed several distinct
	morphologies: at low number of arms{,} pearl-necklace structures
	are formed on individual arms; at higher number of arms inter-arm
	bundling is the dominant structural motif.},
