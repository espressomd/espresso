.. _Creating bonds when particles collide:

Creating bonds when particles collide
-------------------------------------

Please cite :cite:`espresso2` when using dynamic bonding.

With the help of this feature, bonds between particles can be created
automatically during the simulation, every time two particles collide.
This is useful for simulations of chemical reactions and irreversible
adhesion processes. Both, sliding and non-sliding contacts can be created.

The collision detection is controlled via the :attr:`espressomd.system.System.collision_detection` attribute, which is an instance of the class :class:`espressomd.collision_detection.CollisionDetection`.

Several modes are available for different types of binding.

* "bind_centers": adds a pair-bond between two particles at their first collision. By making the bonded interaction `stiff` enough, the particles can be held together after the collision. Note that the particles can still slide on each others' surface, as the pair bond is not directional. This mode is set up as follows::
    import espressomd
    from espressomd.interactions import HarmonicBond
    
    system=espressomd.System()
    bond_centers=HarmonicBond(k=1000,r_0=<CUTOFF>)
    system.bonded_inter.add(bond_centers)
    system.collision_detection.set_params(mode="bind_centers",distance=<CUTOFF>, bond_centers=bond_centers)
  
  The parameters are as follows:
  
    * `distance` is the distance between two particles at which the binding is triggered. This cutoff distance, `<CUTOFF>` in the example above, is typically chosen slightly larger than the particle diameter. It is also a good choice for the equilibrium length of the bond.
    * `bond_centers` is the bonded interaction (an instance of :class:espressomd.interactions.BondedInteraction`) to be created between the particles. No guarantees are made regarding which of the two colliding particles gets the bond. Once there is a bond of this type on any of the colliding particles, no further binding occurs for this pair of particles.

* "bind_at_point_of_collision": this mode prevents sliding of the colliding particles at the contact. This is achieved by
  creating two virtual sites at the point of collision. They are
  rigidly connected to the colliding particles, respectively. A bond is
  then created between the virtual sites, or an angular bond between
  the two colliding particles and the virtual particles. In the latter case,
  the virtual particles are the centers of the angle potentials
  (particle 2 in the description of the angle potential (see :ref:`Bond-angle interactions`).
  Due to the rigid connection between each of the
  particles in the collision and its respective virtual site, a sliding
  at the contact point is no longer possible. See the documentation on
  :ref:`Rigid arrangements of particles` for details. In addition to the bond between the virtual
  sites, the bond between the colliding particles is also created, i.e., the "bind_at_point_of_collision" mode implicitly includes the "bind_centers" mode. You
  can either use a real bonded interaction to prevent wobbling around
  the point of contact or you can use :class:`espressomd.interactions.Virtual` which acts as a marker, only.
  The method is setup as follows::
     
     system.collision_detection.set_params(mode="bind_at_point_of_collision", distance=<CUTOFF>, bond_centers=<BOND_CENTERS>, bond_vs=<BOND_VS>, part_type_vs=<PART_TYPE_VS>, vs_placement=<VS_PLACEMENT>)

  
  The parameters `distance` and `bond_centers` have the same meaning as in the `bind_centers` mode. The remaining parameters are as follows:
    
    * `bond_vs` is the bond to be added between the two virtual sites created on collision. This is either a pair-bond with an equilibrium length matching the distance between the virtual sites, or an angle bond fully stretched in its equilibrium configuration.
    * `part_type_vs` is the particle type assigned to the virtual sites created on collision. In nearly all cases, no non-bonded interactions should be defined for this particle type.
    * `vs_placement` controls, where on the line connecting the centers of the colliding particles, the virtual sites are placed. A value of 0 means that the virtual sites are placed at the same position as the colliding particles on which they are based. A value of 0.5 will result in the virtual sites being placed ad the mid-point between the two colliding particles. A value of 1 will result the virtual site associated to the first colliding particle to be placed at the position of the second colliding particle. In most cases, 0.5, is a good choice. Then, the bond connecting the virtual sites should have an equilibrium length of zero.

* "glue_to_surface": This mode is used to irreversibly attach small particles to the surface of a big particle. It is asymmetric in that several small particles can be bound to a big particle but not vice versa. The small particles can change type after collision to make them `inert`. On collision, a single virtual site is placed and related to the big particle. Then, a bond (`bond_centers`) connects the big and the small particle. A second bond (`bond_vs`) connects the virtual site and the small particle. Further required parameters are:
  
  * `part_type_to_attach_vs_to`: Type of the particle to which the virtual site is attached, i.e., the `big` particle.
  * `part_type_to_be_glued`: Type of the particle bound to the virtual site (the `small` particle).
  * `part_type_after_glueing`: The type assigned to the particle bound to the virtual site (`small` particle) after the collision.
  * `part_type_vs`: Particle type assigned to the virtual site created during the collision. 
  * `distance_glued_particle_to_vs`: Distance of the virtual site to the particle being bound to it (`small` particle).




- "bind_three_particles" allows for the creation of agglomerates which maintain their shape
  similarly to those create by the mode "bind_at_point_of_collision". The present approach works
  without virtual sites. Instead, for each two-particle collision, the
  surrounding is searched for a third particle. If one is found,
  angular bonds are placed to maintain the local shape.
  If all three particles are within the cutoff distance, an angle bond is added
  on each of the three particles in addition
  to the distance based bonds between the particle centers. 
  If two particles are within the cutoff of a central particle (e.g., chain of three particles)
  an angle bond is placed on the central particle.
  The angular bonds being added are determined from the angle between the particles.
  This method does not depend on the particles’ rotational
  degrees of freedom being integrated. Virtual sites are also not
  required.
  The method, along with the corresponding bonds are setup as follows::
        
        n_angle_bonds=181 # 0 to 180 degrees in one degree steps
        for i in range(0,res,1):
           self.s.bonded_inter[i]=Angle_Harmonic(bend=1,phi0=float(i)/(res-1)*np.pi)
        
        # Create the bond passed to bond_centers here and add it to the system
        
        self.s.collision_detection.set_params(mode="bind_three_particles",bond_centers=<BOND_CENTERS>,bond_three_particles=0,three_particle_binding_angle_resolution=res,distance=<CUTOFF>)

  Important: The bonds for the angles are mapped via their numerical bond ids. In this example, ids from 0 to 180 are used. All other bonds required for the simulation need to be added to the system after those bonds. In particular, this applies to the bonded interaction passed via `bond_centers` 


The following limitations currently apply for the collision detection:
* No distinction is currently made between different particle types for the `bind_centers` method.
* The “bind at point of collision” and "glue to surface"  approaches require the feature `VIRTUAL_SITES_RELATIVE` to be activated in `myconfig.hpp`.

* The “bind at point of collision” approach cannot handle collisions
  between virtual sites

.. _Catalytic Reactions:

Catalytic Reactions
-------------------


With the help of the feature ``CATALYTIC_REACTIONS``, one can define three particle types to act as reactant (e.g. :math:`\mathrm{H_2 O_2}`), catalyzer (e.g. platinum), and product (e.g. :math:`\mathrm{O_2}` and :math:`\mathrm{H_2 O}`). The current setup allows one to simulate active swimmers and their chemical propulsion.

For a Janus swimmer consisting of platinum on one hemisphere and gold on the other hemisphere, both surfaces catalytically induce a reaction. We assume an initial abundance of hydrogen peroxide and absence of products, so that back (recombination) reactions seldomly occur at the surface. A typical model for the propulsion of such a particle assumes

.. math::

    \begin{aligned}
      \mathrm{H_2 O_2} &\xrightarrow{\text{Pt}} \mathrm{2 H^{+} + 2 e^{-} + O_2} \\
      \mathrm{2 H^{+} + 2 e^{-} + H_2 O_2} &\xrightarrow{\text{Au}} \mathrm{2 H_2 O}
    \end{aligned}

That is, catalytic surfaces induce a reactions that produce charged species by consuming hydrogen peroxide. It is the change in distribution of charged species that leads to motion of the swimmer, a process referred to as self-electrophoresis. A minimal model for this would be

.. math::

    \begin{aligned}
      A &\xrightarrow{C^{+}} B \\
      B &\xrightarrow{C^{-}} A
    \end{aligned}

where on the upper half of the catalyst :math:`C^{+}` a species :math:`A` is converted into :math:`B`, and on the lower half :math:`C^{-}` the opposite reaction takes place. Note that when :math:`A` and :math:`B` are charged, this reaction conserves charge, provided the rates are equal.

In |es| the orientation of a catalyzer particle is used to define hemispheres; half spaces going through the particle's center. The reaction region is bounded by the *reaction range*: :math:`r`. Inside the reaction range, we react only reactant-product pairs. The particles in a pair are swapped from hemisphere to another with a rate prescribed by

.. math::

    P_{\text{move}} = 1 - \mathrm{e}^{-k_{\mathrm{ct}}\,\Delta t} ,

with the reaction rate :math:`k_{\mathrm{ct}}` and the simulation time step :math:`\Delta t`. A pair may be swapped only once per MD time step, to avoid a no-net-effect situation. That is, we allow an exchange move only when the following conditions are met:

1. Both partners of the reactant-product pair have to reside within the reaction range.
2. The product has to reside in the upper half-space of the reaction range.
3. The reactant has to reside in the lower half-space of the reaction range.

Self-propulsion is achieved by imposing an interaction asymmetry between the partners of a swapped pair. That is, the heterogeneous distribution of chemical species induced by the swapping leads to a net force on the particle, counter balanced by friction.

To set up the system for catalytic reactions the class :class:`espressomd.reaction.Reaction`
can be used.::

    from espressomd.reaction import Reaction

    system = espressomd.System()

    # setting up particles etc

    r = Reaction(product_type=1, reactant_type=2, catalyzer_type=0, ct_range=2, ct_rate=0.2, eq_rate=0)
    r.start()
    r.stop()

    print r

* the first invocation of ``Reaction``, in the above example,  defines a
  reaction with particles of type number 2 as reactant, type 0 as catalyzer and
  type 1 as product [#1]_. The catalytic reaction rate constant is given by :math:`\mathrm{ct\_rate}`
  [#2]_ and to override the default rate constant for the equilibrium reaction
  ( = 0), one can specify it by as ``eq_rata``.  By default each reactant particle is checked
  against each catalyst particle (``react_once=False``). However, when creating
  smooth surfaces using many catalyst particles, it can be desirable to let the
  reaction rate be independent of the surface density of these particles. That
  is, each particle has a likelihood of reacting in the vicinity of the surface
  (distance is less than :math:`r`) as specified by the rate constant, i.e.,
  *not* according to :math:`P_{\text{cvt}} = 1 - \exp \left( - n k\Delta t
  \right)`, with :math:`n` the number of local catalysts. To accomplish this,
  each reactant is considered only once each time step by using the option
  ``react_once=True`` . The reaction command is set up such that the different
  properties may be influenced individually.

*  ``r.stop()`` disables the reaction. Note that at the moment, there can
   only be one reaction in the simulation.

*  ``print r``  returns the current reaction parameters.

In future versions of |es| the capabilities of the ``CATALYTIC_REACTIONS`` feature may be generalized
to handle multiple reactant, catalyzer, and product types, as well as
more general reaction schemes. Other changes may involve merging the
current implementation with the ``COLLISION_DETECTION`` feature.

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#1]
   Only one type of particle can be assigned to each of these three
   reaction species and no particle type may be assigned to multiple
   species. That is, currently does not support particles of type 1 and
   2 both to be reactants, nor can particles of type 1 be a reactant as
   well as a catalyst. Moreover, only one of these reactions can be
   implemented in a single Tcl script. If, for instance, there is a
   reaction involving particle types 1, 2, and 4, there cannot be a
   second reaction involving particles of type 5, 6, and 8. It is
   however possible to modify the reaction properties for a given set of
   types during the simulation.

.. [#2]
   Currently only strictly positive values of the catalytic conversion
   rate constant are allowed. Setting the value to zero is equivalent to
   ``r.stop()``.

    ---------------------------------------

    .. todo::
        This is not implemented for the python interface yet

    nemd exchange nemd shearrate nemd off nemd nemd profile nemd viscosity

    Use NEMD (Non Equilibrium Molecular Dynamics) to simulate a system under
    shear with help of an unphysical momentum change in two slabs in the
    system.

    Variants and will initialize NEMD. Two distinct methods exist. Both
    methods divide the simulation box into slabs that lie parallel to the
    x-y-plane and apply a shear in x direction. The shear is applied in the
    top and the middle slabs. Note, that the methods should be used with a
    DPD thermostat or in an NVE ensemble. Furthermore, you should not use
    other special features like or inside the top and middle slabs. For
    further reference on how NEMD is implemented into see
    :cite:`soddeman01a`.

    Variant chooses the momentum exchange method. In this method, in each
    step the largest positive x-components of the velocity in the middle
    slab are selected and exchanged with the largest negative x-components
    of the velocity in the top slab.

    Variant chooses the shear-rate method. In this method, the targeted
    x-component of the mean velocity in the top and middle slabs are given
    by

    .. math:: {target\_velocity} = \pm {shearrate}\,\frac{L_z}{4}

    where :math:`L_z` is the simulation box size in z-direction. During the
    integration, the x-component of the mean velocities of the top and
    middle slabs are measured. Then, the difference between the mean
    x-velocities and the target x-velocities are added to the x-component of
    the velocities of the particles in the respective slabs.

    Variant will turn off NEMD, variant will print usage information of the
    parameters of NEMD. Variant will return the velocity profile of the
    system in x-direction (mean velocity per slab).

    Variant will return the viscosity of the system, that is computed via

    .. math:: \eta = \frac{F}{\dot{\gamma} L_x L_y}

    where :math:`F` is the mean force (momentum transfer per unit time)
    acting on the slab, :math:`L_x L_y` is the area of the slab and
    :math:`\dot{\gamma}` is the shearrate.

    NEMD as implemented generates a Poiseuille flow, with shear flow rate
    varying over a finite wavelength determined by the box. For a planar
    Couette flow (constant shear, infinite wavelength), consider using
    Lees-Edwards boundary conditions (see ) to drive the shear.

.. _Lees-Edwards boundary conditions:

Lees-Edwards boundary conditions
--------------------------------

To use the Lees-Edwards boundary conditions, the feature ``LEES_EDWARDS`` is required.

Lees-Edwards boundary conditions can be used to introduce a shear flow to the MD simulation. An introduction can be found in :cite:`lees72`. Compared to NEMD simulations they have two big advantages: First, the bulk behavior of the system remains unchanged. Second, the image boxes are moved, whereas the flow within the primary simulation box has to develop on its own. Hence, this allows two additional phenomena: Shear banding can occur as well as non-linear shear profiles can be observed. This makes Lees-Edwards boundary conditions suitable for comparison with rheological experiments. 

Lees-Edwards boundary conditions impose a shear flow of speed :math:`\dot\gamma` by moving the periodic image boxes along the x-direction according to:

.. math:: v_{\text{x, unfolded}} = v_{\text{x, folded}} + \dot\gamma \cdot y_{\text{imagecount}}

:math:`v_{\text{x, unfolded}}` refers to the velocity of a particle outside the main simulation box, :math:`y_{\text{imagecount}}` is the amount of periodic boundaries crossed in the  :math:`y`-direction. 

The absolute offset of the periodic images can be set via

* :py:attr:`~espressomd.System().lees_edwards_offset`

The following example introduces the usage::
    
    import espressomd
    system = espressomd.System()
    absolute_offset = 0.2
    system.lees_edwards_offset = absolute_offset

Lees-Edwards boundary conditions can be used to obtain the shear modulus :math:`G = \frac{\tau}{\gamma}` or the shear viscosity :math:`\eta = \frac{\tau}{\dot\gamma}` outside the linear regime, where Green-Kubo relations are not valid anymore. For this purpose a lees_edwards_offset is set followed by one integration step for multiple times. Strain, strain rate and the shear stress need to be recorded for the calculation. Alternatively a sinusoidal lees_edwards_offset series can be used to carry out oscillatory experiments to calculate viscoelastic moduli (:math:`G', G''`). Furthermore a lees_edwards_offset can be set followed by many integration steps obtain the relaxation behavior of a system. 

When applying a constant shear rate :math:`\dot\gamma` the velocity of the particles changes from :math:`-\frac{\dot\gamma}{2}` at the bottom of the box to :math:`\frac{\dot\gamma}{2}` at the top of the box. 

Physical meaningful values for systems where hydrodynamics play a major role, can only be obtained by including hydrodynamic interactions. Lees-Edwards boundary conditions are implemented in the :ref:`Lattice-Boltzmann` algorithms. For this algorithm the feature ``LB_GPU`` is required. Please refer to chapter :ref:`Lattice-Boltzmann` for more information. 

Lees-Edwards boundary conditions work with the DPD thermostat. In order to correctly observe transport properties, symmetry-breaking or entropy production in relation to shear flow is probably better to use the DPD thermostat (:ref:`Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD)`) once the initial heat-up has been carried out. The DPD thermostat removes kinetic energy from the system based on a frictional term defined relative to a local reference frame of a given particle-pair, without enforcing any specific flow pattern apriori. At high rates of dissipation, this can however lead to an artefactual shear-banding type effect at the periodic boundaries, such that the bulk fluid is nearly stationary. y. This effect is removed using the modification proposed to the DPD thermostat by Chatterjee :cite:`chatterjee2007` to allow treatment of systems with high dissipation rates, which is applied automatically if ``LEES_EDWARDS`` is compiled in. Chatterjee’s modification is just to skip calculation of DPD forces (both dissipative and random) for particle pairs which cross a boundary in y.

The command::

  print(system.lees_edwards_offset)

returns the current value of the offset. If ``LEES_EDWARDS`` is compiled in, then coordinates are folded into the primary simulation box as the integration progresses, to prevent a numerical overflow.

.. _Immersed Boundary Method for soft elastic objects:

Immersed Boundary Method for soft elastic objects
-------------------------------------------------

Please contact the Biofluid Simulation and Modeling Group at the
University of Bayreuth if you plan to use this feature.

This section describes an alternative way to include soft elastic
objects somewhat different from the previous chapter. In the Immersed
Boundary Method (IBM), soft particles are considered as an infinitely
thin shell filled with liquid (see e.g.
 :cite:`Peskin2002,Crowl2010,KruegerThesis`). When the
shell is deformed by an external flow it responds by elastic restoring
forces which are transmitted into the fluid. In the present case, the
inner and outer liquid are of the same type and are simulated using
Lattice-Boltzmann.

Numerically, the shell is discretized by a set of marker points
connected by triangles. The marker points are advected with *exactly*
the local fluid velocity, i.e., they do not possess a mass nor a
friction coefficient (this is different from the Object-in-Fluid method
of the previous chapter). We implement these marker points as virtual
particles in which are not integrated using the usual velocity-verlet
scheme, but instead are propagated using a simple Euler algorithm with
the local fluid velocity (if the ``IMMERSED_BOUNDARY`` feature is turned
on).

To compute the elastic forces, three new bonded interactions are defined
ibm\_triel, ibm\_tribend and ibm\_volCons:

-  ibm\_triel is a discretized elastic force with the following syntax

   inter ibm\_triel

   where , and represent the indices of the three marker points making
   up the triangle. The parameter specifies the maximum stretch above
   which the bond is considered broken. The final parameter can be
   either

   ::

       NeoHookean <k>

   or

   ::

       Skalak <k1> <k2>

   which specifies the elastic law and its corresponding parameters (see
   e.g. :cite:`KruegerThesis`).

-  ibm\_tribend is a discretized bending potential with the following
   syntax

   inter ibm\_tribend

   where , , and are four marker points corresponding to two neighboring
   triangles. The indices and contain the shared edge. Note that the
   marker points within a triangle must be labeled such that the normal
   vector
   :math:`\vec{n} = (\vec{r}_\text{ind2} - \vec{r}_\text{ind1}) \times (\vec{r}_\text{ind3} - \vec{r}_\text{ind1})`
   points outward of the elastic object.

   The parameter allows to specify different numerical ways of computing
   the bending interaction. Currently, two methods are implemented,
   where the first one () follows :cite:`KruegerThesis` and
   the second one () follows :cite:`Gompper1996`. In both
   cases, is the bending modulus. The options or specify whether the
   reference shape is a flat configuration or whether the initial
   configuration is taken as reference shape, this option is only
   available for the method.

-  ibm\_volCons is a volume-conservation force. Without this correction,
   the volume of the soft object tends to shrink over time due to
   numerical inaccuracies. Therefore, this implements an artificial
   force intended to keep the volume constant. If volume conservation is
   to be used for a given soft particle, the interaction must be added
   to every marker point belonging to that object. The syntax is

   inter ibm\_volCons

   where identifies the soft particle and is a volumetric spring
   constant :cite:`KruegerThesis`.


.. _Object-in-fluid:

Object-in-fluid
---------------

Please cite  if you use the object-in-fluid implementation described
below. For more details also see the documentation at
http://cell-in-fluid.fri.uniza.sk/oif-documentation or contact the
Cell-in-fluid Research Group at University of Žilina.

Simulations using work mostly with objects (molecules, atoms, polymers,
colloids, crystals, …) that are physically composed of points linked
together with bonds. These objects are like skeletons, without inner or
outer volume.

The idea behind this module, is to use for objects that do have inner
volume, for example blood cells, magnetic beads, capsules, …The boundary
of an object is covered with triangular mesh. The vertices of the mesh
are declared in as particles. The edges of the mesh define elastic
forces keeping the shape of the object. The movement of object is
achieved by adding forces to the mesh points.

Modeled elastic or rigid objects are immersed in the LB fluid flow. The
fluid interacts with an elastic object resulting in its deformation;
this immediately generates forces acting back on the fluid. The aim is
to describe the immersed object using the notion of particles, and to
create bonds between these particles representing elastic or rigid
forces.

The objects are composed of a membrane encapsulating the fluid inside
the object. For now, the inside fluid must have the same density and
viscosity as the outside fluid. The object is represented by its
membrane (boundary), that is discretized using a triangulation. Such
triangulation defines interacting particles distributed on the surface
of the immersed object :cite:`dupin07`:

-  between two particles, corresponding to the edges in the
   triangulation (modeling the stretching of the membrane),

-  between three particles, corresponding to the triangles of the
   triangulation (local area, or local surface preservation of the
   membrane),

-  between four particles, corresponding to two triangles from the
   triangulation sharing a common edge (bending of the membrane).

The object immersed in the fluid moves under the influence of the
deforming forces, defined through the bonds, and under the influence of
the fluid motion. This interaction is based on the frictional force
between the fluid and the surface particles. Therefore the object moves
in the flow only if there is a nonzero difference between the fluid
velocity and the particle velocity. In other words, there has to be at
least small flow through the membrane, which is in most cases
unphysical. However, this unphysical flow through the membrane is
probably negligible in larger scales.

.. _Membranes:

Membranes
~~~~~~~~~

With this approach, it is easy to model also elastic sheets, or free
membranes that do not necessarily enclose a 3D object. In this case,
area\_force\_global and volume\_force interactions are not needed, since
these two interactions are meant for closed immersed objects.

.. _Parameters:

Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~

There are several parameters involved in this model. All of them should
be calibrated according to the intended application.

-  Mass of the particles. Every particle has its mass, which influences
   the dynamics.

-  Friction coefficient. The main parameter describing the
   fluid-particle interaction is the ``friction \ parameter ``\ rom the
   command ``bf``\ uid .

-  Parameters of elastic moduli. Elastic behavior can be described by
   five different elastic moduli: hyperelastic stretching, linear
   stretching, bending, local and global area preservation and volume
   preservation. Each of them has its own scaling parameter:
   :math:`k_s, ks_{lin}, k_b, k_{al}, k_{ag}, k_v`. Their mathematical
   formulations have been taken from :cite:`dupin07`.

The mass of the particles and the friction coefficient can be calibrated
using the drag coefficients of the ellipsoidal objects. These drag
coefficients have known analytical values and the mass and friction can
be calibrated to fit this values. More details about the calibration can
be found in :cite:`cimrak`.

The elastic parameters are specific to the immersed objects. They
correspond to their physical values. More details about their mechanical
and biological meaning is presented in :cite:`dao03`
specifically for red blood cells. However, the proper calibration to fit
the experimental data has been performed in :cite:`cimrak`.

.. _Geometry:

Geometry
~~~~~~~~

The membrane of the immersed object is triangulated. In
doc/tutorials/03-object\_in\_fluid you can find an example using
deformable objects in the fluid.

|image|

Triangulation can be obtained using various software tools. Two files
are needed for mesh input:
``mesh-nodes.dat`` and ``mesh-triangles.dat``. The parameters of
the mesh are the number of particles on the surface of the immersed
object, denoted by ``mesh_nnode``, and the number of triangular faces
in the triangulation, denoted by ``mesh_ntriangle``. These parameters
are obtained automatically from ``mesh-nodes.dat`` and ``mesh-triangles.dat`` 
by counting the number of lines in respective files.

The ``mesh-nodes.dat`` thus contains ``mesh_nnode`` lines with three
real numbers separated by blank space, representing three coordinates of
the corresponding particle. The membrane is thus discretized into
``mesh_nnode`` particles with IDs starting from 0 to ``mesh_nnode-1``.
The IDs are assigned in the same order as in the ``mesh-nodes.dat``
file.

The ``mesh-triangles.dat`` contains ``mesh_ntriangle`` lines with three
non-negative integers separated by blank space. Each line represents one
triangle in the triangulation. For algorithmic purposes it is crucial to
have defined a correct orientation of the triangle. The orientation is
defined using the normal vector associated with the triangle. The
important rule is that the normal vector of the triangle must point
inside the immersed object.

As an example, let us have one line in the file ``mesh-triangles.dat``
with numbers 4, 0 and 7. This means that particles with IDs 4, 0 and 7
form one triangular face of the triangulation. The orientation is
defined as follows: create two vectors :math:`v_1` and :math:`v_2`, such
that :math:`v_1` is pointing from particle 4 to particle 0, and
:math:`v_2` is pointing from particle 4 to particle 7. Be careful, the
order of vectors and particles matters!

The normal vector :math:`n` is computed as a vector product
:math:`v_1 \times v_2`. The direction of :math:`n` can be determined by
the rule of right hand: the thumb points in the :math:`v_1` direction,
the index finger in the :math:`v_2` direction and the middle finger in
the :math:`n` direction. Following this principle, all the lines in the
``mesh-triangles.dat`` files must be such that the normal vectors of the
corresponding triangles points inside the immersed object.

These two files are sufficient to describe the geometry and topology of
the triangulation. The following geometric entities are necessary for
the definition of bonded interactions: position of the particles, edges,
lengths of the edges, triangles, areas of triangles, angles between two
triangles sharing a common edge, surface of the immersed object, volume
of the immersed object. All these geometrical entities can be computed
using the information from the files ``mesh-nodes.dat`` and
``mesh-triangles.dat`` and the computation is done in the script
``scripts/object_in_fluid.tcl`` .

The script ``scripts/object_in_fluid.tcl`` reads both mesh files,
generates list of edges, and computes all geometrical entities needed
for definition of bonded interactions. It then executes commands
creating the particles, interactions and bonds.An example of ``part``
command is as follows:

::

     part 0 pos 3.0 3.0 6.0 type 1 mol 1 mass 1 

Note, the is feature ``mol`` that used for the particles. We use this
feature we distinguish between different objects. The upper limit for
the number of objects is 10000. However it can be increased by changing
the ``MAX_OBJECTS_IN_FLUID`` constant.

The following example shows an interaction.

::

     inter 106 oif_local_force 1.0 0.5 0.0 1.7 0.6 0.2 0.3 1.1 

This command (“invisible” for the user who executes the
``cript``/object\_in\_fluid.tcl  script) takes care of stretching,
bending and local area conservation all in one interaction with ID 106.
Detailed description of the available types of interactions is presented
in Section [sec:inter-bonded-oif].

.. _Available commands:

Available commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to use the object-in-fluid (OIF) commands and work with
immersed objects, the following features need to be compiled in:
``ASS, \ \verb EXTERNAL_FORCES . We do not specifically require \verb LB, \ \verb LB_BOUNDARIES, \ \verb CONSTRAINTS, \ \verb SOFT_SPHERE, \ \verb ``\ EMBRANE\_COLLISION,
 ``IF_L``\ CAL\_FORCES,  ``IF_GL``\ BAL\_FORCES.  They are most likely
to be used (for objects immersed in fluid and interacting with
boundaries and each other), but they are not necessary for the following
commands. For up-to-date overview of available oif commands see the OIF
user guide at cell-in-fluid.fri.uniza.sk/oif-documentation.

.. _Initialisation:

Initialisation

oif\_init

Must be used before any other OIF command, initializes all global
variables and lists, does not take any arguments.

oif\_info

Prints information about whole framework, all global variables,
currently available templates and objects, etc. Does not take any
arguments.

.. _Templates for objects:

Templates for objects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

template-id nodes-file triangles-file

This command creates a template that will be used for all objects that
share the same elastic properties and have the same triangulation.

specifies a unique ID for each template. The first template has the ID
0. The following ones need to be be numbered consecutively.

input file, each line contains three real numbers. These are the
:math:`x, y, z` coordinates of individual surface mesh nodes of the
objects.

input file, each line contains three integers. These are the ID numbers
of the mesh nodes as they appear in . Note, the first node has ID 0.

coefficients by which the coordinates stored in will be stretched in the
:math:`x, y, z` direction. The default values are 1.0 1.0 1.0.

| whether the respective coordinate will be flipped around 0.
  Coefficients :math:`x, y, z` must be either 0 or 1. The reflection of
  only one coordinate is allowed so at most one number is 1, others are
  0. For example ``mirror`` *0 1 0* results in flipping the spatial
  point :math:`(x,y,z)` to :math:`(x,-y,z)`. The default value is 0 0 0.

elastic modulus for hyperelastic stretching forces

elastic modulus for linear stretching forces

elastic modulus for bending forces

elastic modulus for local area forces

elastic modulus for global area forces

elastic modulus for volume forces

switch to turn on the computation of local outward normal vectors

The four switches ``ks``, ``kslin``, ``kb`` and ``kal`` set elastic
parameters for local interactions - ``ks`` for hyperelastic edge
stiffness, ``kslin`` for linear edge stiffness, ``kb`` for angle
preservation stiffness and ``kal`` for triangle surface preservation
stiffness. This stiffness can be either uniform over the whole object,
or non-uniform. In case of stretching modulus, we can have spring
stiffness the same for all edges in the whole object, or we can choose
the value for every edge of the object separately. Analogically, for
``kslin``, for ``kal`` and ``kb``. Therefore, there are two options for
setting ``ks``, ``kslin``, ``kal`` and ``kb`` stiffness. Here is the
explanation for ``ks``:

-  **Uniform stiffness:** To set uniform hyperelastic stiffness for all
   edges in the object, use ``ks``

-  **Non-uniform stiffness:** To set non-uniform hyperelastic stiffness,
   prepare a file with number of lines equal to the number of edges of
   the triangulation. Each line should contain a real number between 0
   and 1, so called “weight”. Then call ``ks`` This command reads the
   weights :math:`weight_i` for each edge and the stiffness for that
   edge is set to

   .. math:: ks_i = ksMin * (1 - weight_i) + ksMax*(weight_i)

   For bending stiffness, must contain the same number of lines as there
   are edges in the object. However, for local area preservation, the
   stiffness constant is linked to triangles. Therefore, must contain
   the same number of lines as there are triangles in the object.

.. _Elastic objects:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

object-id template-id origin part-type

corresponding elastic moduli.

ones should be numbered consecutively.

same ``part-type``. One can have more objects with the same type of
particles, but this is not recommended, because the interactions between
objects are set up using these types.

:math:`x, y, z` axis. Default values are 0.0 0.0 0.0.

this parameter refers to the mass of one particle (one mesh point of the
triangulation). For the proper setting, the mass of the whole membrane
must be distributed to all mesh points. Default value is 1.0.

.. _Mesh analysis:

Mesh analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

oif\_mesh\_analyze nodes-file triangles-file

This command is useful for some preparatory work with mesh before it is
used for creating elastic objects.

- file with coordinates of the mesh nodes. The center of the object
  should be as close to (0,0,0) as possible.

- file with incidences for all triangles. Each line of this file
  contains three integer IDs (starting from 0) with indices of three
  vertices forming one triangle.

checks whether all triangles of the surface mesh are properly oriented.
For now, only works for convex (or almost convex) objects.

outputs the corrected file into . For now, only works for convex (or
almost convex) objects. needs to be set to 1.

subtracts 1 from all numbers in and saves a new file . This is useful,
if the mesh generating software starts numbering the particles from 1
instead of 0.

.. _Output information about specific object:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

object-id

This command is used to output information about the object that can be
used for visualization or as input for other simulations.

- the id of the object

outputs the mesh of the object to the desired . Paraview can directly
visualize this file.

the same as the previous option, however the whole object is shift such
that it is visualized within the simulation box. This option is useful
for simulating periodical processes when objects flowing out on one side
of simulation box are transferred to the opposite side.

outputs affinity bonds that are currently activated. If no bonds are
present, the file will be generated anyway with no bonds to visualize.
Paraview can directly visualize this file.

outputs the positions of the mesh nodes to . In fact, this command
creates a new file that can be used by ``oif_object_set``. The center of
the object is located at point (0,0,0). This command is aimed to store
the deformed shape in order to be loaded later.

.. _Descriptive information about specific object:

object-id

This command is used to output information about the properties of the
object. Some of these properties can also be visualized.

- the id of the object

- outputs the location of the center of the object

computes six extremal coordinates of the object. More precisely, runs
through the all mesh points and remembers the minimal and maximal
:math:`x`-coordinate, :math:`y`-coordinate and :math:`z`-coordinate. If
is one of these: *z-min, z-max, x-min, x-max, y-min, y-max* then the
procedure returns one number according to the value of . If is , then
the procedure returns a list of six numbers, namely *x-min, x-max,
y-min, y-max, z-min, z-max*.

- outputs the approximate location of the center of the object. It is
  computed as average of 6 mesh points that have extremal :math:`x`,
  :math:`y` and :math:`z` coordinates at the time of object loading.

- outputs the minimum, average and maximum edge length of the object and
  corresponding standard deviation

  points and calculates their average velocity.

.. _Setting properties for specific object:

Setting properties for specific object
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

object-id

This command sets some properties of the object.

- the id of the object

- sets the force vector () to all mesh nodes of the object. Setting is
  done using command ``part $i set ext_force`` . Note, that this command
  sets the external force in each integrate step. So if you want to use
  the external force only in one iteration, you need to set zero external
  force in the following integrate step

- moves the object so that the origin has coordinates

- deforms the object such that its origin stays unchanged, however the
  relative positions of the mesh points are taken from file . The file
  should contain the coordinates of the mesh points with the origin’s
  location at (0,0,0). The procedure also checks whether number of lines
  in the file is the same as the number of triangulation nodes of the
  object.

- stops all the particles in the object (analogue to the ``part ``
  ``fix 1 1 1`` command for single particles).

- releases the particles in the object (analogue to the ``part ``
  `` unfix`` command for single particles).

.. _Object-in-fluid interactions:

Object-in-fluid interactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please cite :cite:`cimrak` when using the interactions in this section in order to
simulate extended objects embedded in a LB fluid. For more details also
see the documentation at http://cell-in-fluid.fri.uniza.sk/oif-documentation.

The following interactions are implemented in order to mimic the
mechanics of elastic or rigid objects immersed in the LB fluid flow.
Their mathematical formulations were inspired by
:cite:`dupin07`. Details on how the bonds can be used for
modeling objects are described in section :ref:`Object-in-fluid`.

.. _OIF local forces:

OIF local forces
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

OIF local forces are available through the :class:`espressomd.interactions.OifLocalForces` class.

This type of interaction is available for closed 3D immersed objects as
well as for 2D sheet flowing in the 3D flow.

This interaction comprises three different concepts. The local
elasticity of biological membranes can be captured by three different
elastic moduli. Stretching of the membrane, bending of the membrane and
local preservation of the surface area. Parameters
:math:`{L^0_{AB}},\ {k_s},\ {k_{slin}}` define the stretching,
parameters :math:`\phi,\ k_b` define the bending, and
:math:`A_1,\ A_2,\ k_{al}` define the preservation of local area. They
can be used all together, or, by setting any of
:math:`k_s, k_{slin}, k_b, k_{al}` to zero, the corresponding modulus
can be turned off.

.. _Stretching:

Stretching
""""""""""

For each edge of the mesh, :math:`L_{AB}` is the current distance between point :math:`A` and
point :math:`B`. :math:`L^0_{AB}` is the distance between these points in the relaxed state, that
is if the current edge has the length exactly , then no forces are
added. :math:`\Delta L_{AB}` is the deviation from the relaxed
state, that is :math:`\Delta L_{AB} = L_{AB} - L_{AB}^0`. The
stretching force between :math:`A` and :math:`B` is calculated using

.. math:: F_s(A,B) = (k_s\kappa(\lambda_{AB}) + k_{s,\mathrm{lin}})\Delta L_{AB}n_{AB}.

Here, :math:`n_{AB}` is the unit vector pointing from :math:`A` to :math:`B`, `k_s` is the
constant for nonlinear stretching, :math:`k_{s,\mathrm{lin}}` is the constant for 
linear stretching, :math:`\lambda_{AB} = L_{AB}/L_{AB}^0`, and :math:`\kappa`
is a nonlinear function that resembles neo-Hookean behavior

.. math::

   \kappa(\lambda_{AB}) = \frac{\lambda_{AB}^{0.5} + \lambda_{AB}^{-2.5}}
   {\lambda_{AB} + \lambda_{AB}^{-3}}.

Typically, one wants either nonlinear or linear behavior and therefore
one of :math:`k_s, k_{s,\mathrm{lin}}` is zero. Nonetheless the interaction will work if
both constants are non-zero.

|image_oif_streching|

.. _Bending:

Bending
"""""""

The tendency of an elastic object to maintain the resting shape is
achieved by prescribing the preferred angles between neighboring
triangles of the mesh.

Denote the angle between two triangles in the resting shape by
:math:`\theta^0`. For closed immersed objects, one always has to set the
inner angle. The deviation of this angle
:math:`\Delta \theta = \theta - \theta^0` defines two bending forces for
two triangles :math:`A_1BC` and :math:`A_2BC`

.. math:: F_{bi}(A_iBC) = k_b\frac{\Delta \theta}{\theta^0} n_{A_iBC}

Here, :math:`n_{A_iBC}` is the unit normal vector to the triangle :math:`A_iBC`.
The force :math:`F_{bi}(A_iBC)` is assigned
to the vertex not belonging to the common edge. The opposite force
divided by two is assigned to the two vertices lying on the common edge.
This procedure is done twice, for :math:`i=1` and for
:math:`i=2`.

|image_oif_bending|

.. _Local area conservation:

Local area conservation
"""""""""""""""""""""""

This interaction conserves the area of the triangles in the
triangulation.

The deviation of the triangle surface :math:`S_{ABC}` is computed from the triangle
surface in the resting shape
:math:`\Delta S_{ABC} = S_{ABC} - S_{ABC}^0`. The area
constraint assigns the following shrinking/expanding force to every
vertex

.. math:: F_{al}(A) = -k_{al}\frac{\Delta S_{ABC}}{\sqrt{S_{ABC}}}w_{A}

where :math:`k_{al}` is the area constraint coefficient, and :math:`w_{A}` is the unit vector
pointing from the centroid of triangle :math:`ABC` to the vertex :math:`A`. Similarly the
analogical forces are assigned to :math:`B` and :math:`C`.

.. todo:: Rest of this section is still Tcl syntax

OIF local force is asymmetric. After creating the interaction

::

    inter 33 oif_local_force 1.0 0.5 0.0 1.7 0.6 0.2 0.3 1.1

it is important how the bond is created. Particles need to be mentioned
in the correct order. Command

::

    part 0 bond 33 1 2 3

creates a bond related to the triangles 012 and 123. The particle 0
corresponds to point A1, particle 1 to C, particle 2 to B and particle 3
to A2. There are two rules that need to be fulfilled:

-  there has to be an edge between particles 1 and 2

-  orientation of the triangle 012, that is the normal vector defined as
   a vector product :math:`01 \times 02`, must point to the inside of
   the immersed object.

Then the stretching force is applied to particles 1 and 2, with the
relaxed length being 1.0. The bending force is applied to preserve the
angle between triangles 012 and 123 with relaxed angle 1.7 and finally,
local area force is applied to both triangles 012 and 123 with relaxed
area of triangle 012 being 0.2 and relaxed area of triangle 123 being
0.3.

Notice that also concave objects can be defined. If :math:`\theta_0` is
larger than :math:`\pi`, then the inner angle is concave.

.. _OIF global forces:

OIF global forces
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

OIF global forces are available through the
:class:`espressomd.interactions.OifGlobalForces` class.

This type of interaction is available solely for closed 3D immersed
objects.

It comprises two concepts: preservation of global surface
and of volume of the object. The parameters :math:`S^0, k_{ag}`
define preservation of the surface while parameters
:math:`V^0, k_{v}` define volume preservation. They can be
used together, or, by setting either :math:`k_{ag}` or :math:`k_{v}` to
zero, the corresponding modulus can be turned off.

.. _Global area conservation:

Global area conservation
""""""""""""""""""""""""

The global area conservation force is defined as

.. math:: F_{ag}(A) = - k_{ag}\frac{\Delta S}{S}w_{A},

where :math:`S` denotes the current surface of the immersed object, :math:`S_0` the surface in
the relaxed state and :math:`\Delta S = S - S_0`.

Here, the above mentioned force divided by 3 is added to all three
particles.

|image_oif_area|

.. _Volume conservation:

Volume conservation
"""""""""""""""""""

The deviation of the objects volume :math:`V` is computed from the volume in the
resting shape :math:`\Delta V = V - V^0`. For each
triangle the following force is computed

.. math:: F_v(ABC) = -k_v\frac{\Delta V}{V^0} S_{ABC} n_{ABC}

where :math:`S_{ABC}` is the area of triangle :math:`ABC`, :math:`n_{ABC}` is the
normal unit vector of the plane spanned by :math:`ABC`, and :math:`k_v`
is the volume constraint coefficient. The volume of one immersed object
is computed from

.. math:: V = \sum_{ABC}S_{ABC}\ n_{ABC}\cdot h_{ABC},

where the sum is computed over all triangles of the mesh and :math:`h_{ABC}` is the
normal vector from the centroid of triangle :math:`ABC` to any plane which does not
cross the cell. The force :math:`F_v(ABC)` is equally distributed to all three vertices
:math:`A, B, C.`

|image_oif_volume|

.. todo:: Rest of section still Tcl syntax

This interaction is symmetric. After the definition of the interaction
by

::

    inter 22 oif_global_force 65.3 3.0 57.0 2.0

the order of vertices is crucial. By the following command the bonds are
defined

::

    part 0 bond 22 1 2

Triangle 012 must have correct orientation, that is the normal vector
defined by a vector product :math:`01\times02`. The orientation must
point inside the immersed object.

.. _Out direction:

Out direction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

inter oif_out_direction

This type of interaction is primarily for closed 3D immersed objects to
compute the input for membrane collision. After creating the interaction

::

    inter 66 oif_out_direction

it is important how the bond is created. Particles need to be mentioned
in the correct order. Command

::

    part 0 bond 66 1 2 3

calculates the outward normal vector of triangle defined by particles 1,
2, 3 (these should be selected in such a way that particle 0 lies
approximately at its centroid - for OIF objects, this is automatically
handled by oif_create_template command, see Section
[ssec:oif-create-template]). In order for the direction to be outward
with respect to the underlying object, the triangle 123 needs to be
properly oriented (as explained in the section on volume in
oif_global_forces interaction).

.. _Electrokinetics:

Electrokinetics
---------------

The electrokinetics setup in |es| allows for the description of
electro-hydrodynamic systems on the level of ion density distributions
coupled to a Lattice-Boltzmann (LB) fluid. The ion density distributions
may also interact with explicit charged particles, which are
interpolated on the LB grid. In the following paragraph we briefly
explain the electrokinetic model implemented in |es|, before we come to the
description of the interface.

.. _Electrokinetic Equations:

Electrokinetic Equations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the electrokinetics code we solve the following system of coupled
continuity, diffusion-advection, Poisson, and Navier-Stokes equations:

.. math::
   
   \begin{aligned}
   \label{eq:ek-model-continuity} \frac{\partial n_k}{\partial t} & = & -\, \nabla \cdot \vec{j}_k \vphantom{\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial}\right)} ; \\
   \label{eq:ek-model-fluxes} \vec{j}_{k} & = & -D_k \nabla n_k - \nu_k \, q_k n_k\, \nabla \Phi + n_k \vec{v}_{\mathrm{fl}} \vphantom{\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial}\right)} ; \\
   \label{eq:ek-model-poisson} \Delta \Phi & = & -4 \pi \, {l_\mathrm{B}}\, {k_\mathrm{B}T}\sum_k q_k n_k \vphantom{\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial}\right)}; \\
   \nonumber \left(\frac{\partial \vec{v}_{\mathrm{fl}}}{\partial t} + \vec{v}_{\mathrm{fl}} \cdot \vec{\nabla} \vec{v}_{\mathrm{fl}} \right) \rho_\mathrm{fl} & = & -{k_\mathrm{B}T}\, \nabla \rho_\mathrm{fl} - q_k n_k \nabla \Phi \\
   \label{eq:ek-model-velocity} & & +\, \eta \vec{\Delta} \vec{v}_{\mathrm{fl}} + (\eta / 3 + \eta_{\text{b}}) \nabla (\nabla \cdot \vec{v}_{\mathrm{fl}}) \vphantom{\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial}\right)} ; \\
   \label{eq:ek-model-continuity-fl} \frac{\partial \rho_\mathrm{fl}}{\partial t} & = & -\,\nabla\cdot\left( \rho_\mathrm{fl} \vec{v}_{\mathrm{fl}} \right) \vphantom{\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial}\right)} , \end{aligned}

which define relations between the following observables

:math:`n_k`
    the number density of the particles of species :math:`k`,

:math:`\vec{j}_k`
    the number density flux of the particles of species :math:`k`,

:math:`\Phi`
    the electrostatic potential,

:math:`\rho_{\mathrm{fl}}`
    the mass density of the fluid,

:math:`\vec{v}_{\mathrm{fl}}`
    the advective velocity of the fluid,

and input parameters

:math:`D_k`
    the diffusion constant of species :math:`k`,

:math:`\nu_k`
    the mobility of species :math:`k`,

:math:`q_k`
    the charge of a single particle of species :math:`k`,

:math:`{l_\mathrm{B}}`
    the Bjerrum length,

:math:`{k_\mathrm{B}T}`
    | the thermal energy given by the product of Boltzmann’s constant
      :math:`k_\text{B}`
    | and the temperature :math:`T`,

:math:`\eta`
    the dynamic viscosity of the fluid,

:math:`\eta_{\text{b}}`
    the bulk viscosity of the fluid.

The temperature :math:`T`, and diffusion constants :math:`D_k` and
mobilities :math:`\nu_k` of individual species are linked through the
Einstein-Smoluchowski relation :math:`D_k /
\nu_k = {k_\mathrm{B}T}`. This system of equations
combining diffusion-advection, electrostatics, and hydrodynamics is
conventionally referred to as the *Electrokinetic Equations*.

The electrokinetic equations have the following properties:

-  On the coarse time and length scale of the model, the dynamics of the
   particle species can be described in terms of smooth density
   distributions and potentials as opposed to the microscale where
   highly localized densities cause singularities in the potential.

   In most situations, this restricts the application of the model to
   species of monovalent ions, since ions of higher valency typically
   show strong condensation and correlation effects – the localization
   of individual ions in local potential minima and the subsequent
   correlated motion with the charges causing this minima.

-  Only the entropy of an ideal gas and electrostatic interactions are
   accounted for. In particular, there is no excluded volume.

   This restricts the application of the model to monovalent ions and
   moderate charge densities. At higher valencies or densities,
   overcharging and layering effects can occur, which lead to
   non-monotonic charge densities and potentials, that can not be
   covered by a mean-field model such as Poisson-Boltzmann or this one.

   Even in salt free systems containing only counter ions, the
   counter-ion densities close to highly charged objects can be
   overestimated when neglecting excluded volume effects. Decades of the
   application of Poisson-Boltzmann theory to systems of electrolytic
   solutions, however, show that those conditions are fulfilled for
   monovalent salt ions (such as sodium chloride or potassium chloride)
   at experimentally realizable concentrations.

-  Electrodynamic and magnetic effects play no role. Electrolytic
   solutions fulfill those conditions as long as they don’t contain
   magnetic particles.

-  The diffusion coefficient is a scalar, which means there can not be
   any cross-diffusion. Additionally, the diffusive behavior has been
   deduced using a formalism relying on the notion of a local
   equilibrium. The resulting diffusion equation, however, is known to
   be valid also far from equilibrium.

-  The temperature is constant throughout the system.

-  The density fluxes instantaneously relax to their local equilibrium
   values. Obviously one can not extract information about processes on
   length and time scales not covered by the model, such as dielectric
   spectra at frequencies, high enough that they correspond to times
   faster than the diffusive time scales of the charged species.

    sys.actors.add(ek)

.. note:: `Feature ELECTROKINETICS and LB_GPU required`

The above is a minimal example how to initialize the LB fluid, and
it is very similar to the Lattice-Boltzmann command in set-up. We
therefore refer the reader to Chapter :ref:`Lattice-Boltzmann` for details on the
implementation of LB in |es| and describe only the major differences here.

The first major difference with the LB implementation is that the
electrokinetics set-up is a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) only
implementation. There is no Central Processing Unit (CPU) version, and
at this time there are no plans to make a CPU version available in the
future. To use the electrokinetics features it is therefore imperative
that your computer contains a CUDA capable GPU which is sufficiently
modern.

To set up a proper LB fluid using this command one has to specify at
least the following options: ``agrid``, ``lb_density``, ``viscosity``, ``friction``, ``T``, and ``prefactor``. The other options can be
used to modify the behavior of the LB fluid. Note that the command does
not allow the user to set the time step parameter as is the case for the
Lattice-Boltzmann command, this parameter is instead taken directly from the value set for
:attr:`espressomd.system.System.time_step`. The LB `mass density` is set independently from the
electrokinetic `number densities`, since the LB fluid serves only as a
medium through which hydrodynamic interactions are propagated, as will
be explained further in the next paragraph. If no ``lb_density`` is specified, then our
algorithm assumes ``lb_density= 1.0``. The two ‘new’ parameters are the temperature ``T`` at
which the diffusive species are simulated and the ``prefactor``
associated with the electrostatic properties of the medium. See the
above description of the electrokinetic equations for an explanation of
the introduction of a temperature, which does not come in directly via a
thermostat that produces thermal fluctuations.

``advection`` can be set to `True` or `False`. It controls whether there should be an
advective contribution to the diffusive species’ fluxes. Default is
`True`.

``fluid_coulping`` can be set to `friction` or `estatics`. This option determines the force
term acting on the fluid. The former specifies the force term to be the
sum of the species fluxes divided by their respective mobilities while
the latter simply uses the electrostatic force density acting on all
species. Note that this switching is only possible for the linkcentered
stencil. For all other stencils, this choice is hardcoded. The default
is `friction`.


The feature `EK_ELECTROSTATIC_COUPLING` enables the action of the electrostatic potential due to the
electrokinetics species and charged boundaries on the MD particles. The
forces on the particles are calculated by interpolation from the
electric field which is in turn calculated from the potential via finite
differences. This only includes interactions between the species and
boundaries and MD particles, not between MD particles and MD particles.
To get complete electrostatic interactions a particles Coulomb method
like Ewald or P3M has to be activated too.

.. _Diffusive Species:

Diffusive Species
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
::

    species = electrokinetics.Species(density=density, D=D, valency=valency, ext_force=ext_force)

:class:`espressomd.electrokinetics.Species` is used to initialize a diffusive species. Here the
options specify: the number density ``density``, the diffusion coefficient ``D``, the
valency of the particles of that species ``valency``, and an optional external
(electric) force which is applied to the diffusive species. As mentioned
before, the LB density is completely decoupled from the electrokinetic
densities. This has the advantage that greater freedom can be achieved
in matching the internal parameters to an experimental system. Moreover,
it is possible to choose parameters for which the LB is more stable. The species has to be added to a LB fluid::

    ek.add_species(species)

The LB fluid must be set up before using :class:`espressomd.electrokinetics.Electrokinetics` as shown above, before a diffusive species can be added. The variables ``density``, ``D``, and ``valency`` must be set to properly initialize the diffusive species; the ``ext_force`` is
optional.

.. _Boundaries:

Boundaries
^^^^^^^^^^
::

    ek_boundary = espressomd.electrokinetics.EKBoundary(charge_density=1.0, shape=my_shape)
    system.ekboundaries.add(ek_boundary)

.. note:: `Feature EK_BOUNDARIES required`

The EKBoundary command allows one to set up (internal or external) boundaries for
the electrokinetics algorithm in much the same way as the command is
used for the LB fluid. The major difference with the LB command is given
by the option ``charge_density``, with which a boundary can be endowed with a volume
charge density. To create a surface charge density, a combination of two
oppositely charged boundaries, one inside the other, can be used.
However, care should be taken to maintain the surface charge density when the value of ``agrid``
is changed. Examples for possible shapes are wall, sphere, ellipsoid, cylinder, rhomboid and hollowcone. We refer to the documentation of the :class:`espressomd.shapes` module for more possible shapes and information on the options associated to these shapes. In order to properly set up the boundaries, the ``charge_density`` and ``shape``
must be specified.

.. _Fields:

Fields
^^^^^^

::

    ek.print_vtk_boundary(path)
    ek.print_vtk_density(path)
    ek.print_vtk_velocity(path)
    ek.print_vtk_potential(path)

A property of the fluid field can be exported into a
file in one go. Currently supported
are: density, velocity, potential and boundary, which give the LB fluid density, the LB fluid velocity,
the electrostatic potential, and the location and type of the
boundaries, respectively. The boundaries can only be printed when the
``EK_BOUNDARIES`` is compiled in. The output is a vtk-file, which is readable by
visualization software such as paraview [5]_ and mayavi2 [6]_.

::

    species.print_vtk_flux(path)
    species.print_vtk_density(path)

These commands are similar to the above. They enable the
export of diffusive species properties, namely: `density` and `flux`, which specify the
number density and flux of species `species`, respectively.

.. _Local Quantities:

Local Quantities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    ek[0,0,0].velocity
    ek[0,0,0].potential
    ek[0,0,0].pressure

A single node can be addressed using three integer values
which run from 0 to `dim_x/agrid`, `dim_y/agrid`, and `dim_z/agrid`, respectively. The
velocity, electrostatic potential and the pressure of a LB fluid node can be obtained this way.

The local `density` and `flux` of a species can be obtained in the same fashion:

::

    species[0,0,0].density
    species[0,0,0].flux

.. _Particle polarizability with thermalized cold Drude oszillators:

Particle polarizability with thermalized cold Drude oszillators
---------------------------------------------------------------

.. note::

    Requires features THOLE, P3M, LANGEVIN_PER_PARTICLE.

.. note::

    Drude is only available for the P3M electrostatics solver and the Langevin thermostat.

**Thermalized cold drude oszillators** can be used to simulate
polarizable particles.  The basic idea is to add a 'charge-on-a-spring' (Drude
charge) to a particle (Drude core) that mimics an electron cloud which can be
elongated to create a dynamically inducible dipole. The energetic minimum of
the Drude charge can be obtained self-consistently, which requires several
iterations of the system's electrostatics and is usually considered
computational expensive. However, with thermalized cold Drude oszillators, the
distance between Drude charge and core is coupled to a thermostat so that it
fluctuates around the SCF solution. This thermostat is kept at a low
temperature compared to the global temperature to minimize the heat flow into
the system. A second thermostat is applied on the centre of mass of the Drude
charge + core system to maintain the global temperature. The downside of this
approach is that usually a smaller time step has to be used to resolve the high
frequency oscillations of the spring to get a stable system.

In |es|, the basic ingredients to simulate such a system are split into three bonds:

1. A :ref:`Harmonic Bond` to account for the spring.
2. A :ref:`Thermalized distance bond` with a cold thermostat on the Drude-Core distance.
3. A :ref:`Subtract P3M short-range bond` to cancel the electrostatic interaction between Drude and core particles.

The system-wide thermostat has to be applied to the centre of mass and not to
the core particle directly. Therefore, the particles have to be excluded from
global thermostating.  With ``LANGEVIN_PER_PARTICLE`` enabled, we set the
temperature and friction coefficient of the Drude complex to zero, which allows
to still use a global Langevin thermostat for non-polarizable particles.

As the Drude charge should not alter the *charge* or *mass* of the Drude
complex, both properties have to be subtracted from the core when adding the
drude particle. In the following convention, we assume that the Drude charge is
**always negative**. It is calculated via the spring constant :math:`k` and
polarizability :math:`\alpha` (in units of inverse volume) with :math:`q_d =
-\sqrt{k \cdot \alpha}`.

The following helper method takes into account all the preceding considerations
and can be used to convenientely add a drude particle to a given core particle.
As it also adds the first two bonds between Drude and core, these bonds have to
be created beforehand::

    from drude_functions import *
    add_drude_particle_to_core(<system>, <harmonic_bond>, <thermalized_bond>, <core particle>, <id drude>, <type drude>, <alpha>, <mass drude>, <coulomb_prefactor>, <thole damping>, <verbose>)

The arguments of the helper function are:
    * <system>: The espressomd.System().
    * <harmonic_bond>: The harmonic bond of the charge-on-a-spring. This is
      added between core and newly generated Drude particle 
    * <thermalized_bond>: The thermalized distance bond for the cold and hot
      thermostats.
    * <core particle>: The core particle on which the drude particle is added.
    * <id drude>: The user-defined id of the drude particle that is created.
    * <type drude>: The user-defined type of the drude particle. 
      Each drude particle of each complex should have an
      individual type (e.g. in an ionic system with Anions (type 0) and Cations
      (type 1), two new, individual Drude types have to be assigned).
    * <alpha>: The polarizability volume.
    * <coulomb_prefactor>: The coulomb prefactor of the system. Used to
      calculate the drude charge from the polarizability and the spring constant
      of the drude bond.  
    * <thole damping>: (optional) An individual thole damping parameter for the
      core-drude pair. Only relevant if thole damping is used (defaults to 2.6).
    * <verbose>: (bool, optional) Prints out information about the added Drude
      particles (default: False)

What is still missing is the short-range exclusion bond between all Drude-core pairs.
One bond type of this kind is needed per Drude type. The above helper function also 
tracks particle types, ids and charges of Drude and core particles, so a simple call of
another helper function:: 

    drude_helpers.setup_and_add_drude_exclusion_bonds(S)

will use this data to create a :ref:`Subtract P3M short-range bond` per Drude type
and set it up it between all Drude and core particles collected in calls of ``add_drude_particle_to_core()``.

.. _Canceling intramolecular electrostatics:

Canceling intramolecular electrostatics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that for polarizable **molecules** (i.e. connected particles, coarse grained
models etc.) with partial charges on the molecule sites, the drude charges will
have electrostatic interaction with other cores of the molecule. Often, this
is unwanted, as it might be already part of the force-field (via. partial
charges or parametrization of the covalent bonds). Without any further
measures, the elongation of the drude particles will be greatly affected be the
close-by partial charges of the molecule. To prevent this, one has to cancel
the interaction of the drude charge with the partial charges of the cores
within the molecule. This can be done with special bonds that subtracts the P3M
short-range interaction of the charge portion `q_d q_{partial}`. This ensures
that only the *dipolar interaction* inside the molecule remains. It should be
considered that the error of this approximation increases with the share of the
long-range part of the electrostatic interaction. Two helper methods assist
with setting up this exclusion. If used, they have to be called
after all drude particles are added to the system::

    setup_intramol_exclusion_bonds(<system>, <molecule drude types>, <molecule core types>, <molecule core partial charges>, <verbose>)

This function creates the requires number of bonds which are later added to the
particles. It has to be called only once. In a molecule with `N` polarizable
sites, `N*(N-1)` bond types are needed to cover all the combinations.
Parameters are:

    * <system>: The espressomd.System().
    * <molecule drude types>: List of the drude types within the molecule.
    * <molecule core types>: List of the core types within the molecue that have partial charges.
    * <molecule core partial charges>: List of the partial charges on the cores.
    * <verbose>: (bool, optional) Prints out information about the created bonds (default: False)

After setting up the bonds, one has to add them to each molecule with the
following method::

    add_intramol_exclusion_bonds(<system>, <drude ids>, <core ids>, <verbose>)

This method has to be called for all molecules and needs the following parameters:

    * <system>: The espressomd.System().
    * <drude ids>: The ids of the drude particles within one molecule.
    * <core ids>: The ids of the core particles within one molecule.
    * <verbose>: (bool, optional) Prints out information about the added bonds (default: False)

Internally, this is done with the bond descibed in  :ref:`Subtract P3M short-range bond`, that
simply adds the p3m shortrange pair-force of scale `- q_d q_{partial}` the to
bonded particles.

.. seealso:: 

    Often used in conjunction with Drude oscillators is the :ref:`Thole correction`
    to damp dipole-dipole interactions on short distances. It is available in |es| 
    as a non-bonded interaction.
