Community support and mailing lists
-----------------------------------

If you have any questions concerning which you cannot resolve by
yourself, you may post a message to the mailing list. Instructions on
how to register to the mailing lists and post messages can be found on
the homepage http://espressomd.org. Before posting a question and
waiting for someone to answer, it may be useful to search the mailing
list archives or FAQ and see if you can get the answer immediately. For
several reasons it is recommended to send all questions to the mailing
lists rather than to contact individual developers:

-  All registered users get your message and you have a higher
   probability that it is answered soon.

-  Your question and the answers are archived and the archives can be
   searched by others.

-  The answer may be useful also to other registered users.

-  There may not be a unique answer to your problem and it may be useful
   to get suggestions from different people.

Please remember that this is a community mailing list. It is other users
and developers who are answering your questions. They do it in their
free time and are not paid for doing it.

.. _Contributing your own code:

Contributing your own code
--------------------------

If you are planning to make an extension to or already have a piece of
your own code which could be useful to others, you are very welcome to
contribute it to the community. Before you start making any changes to
the code, you should obtain the current development version of it. For
more information about how to obtain the development version, refer to
the :ref:`Developers guide`.

If you are looking for good ways to get started with contributing, please
have a look on the information available on github_.

It is also generally a good idea to contact the mailing lists before you
start major coding projects. It might be that someone else is already
working on the problem or has a solution at hand.

You find more detailed information on our developement processes in the
:ref:`Developers guide`.
