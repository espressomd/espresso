.. _Introduction:

Introduction
============

|es| is a simulation package designed to perform Molecular Dynamics (MD) and
Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. It is meant to be a universal tool for
simulations of a variety of soft matter systems. It :ref:`features<Features>` a
broad range of interaction potentials which opens up possibilities for
performing simulations using models with different levels of coarse-graining.
It also includes modern and efficient algorithms for treatment of
:ref:`electrostatics` (P3M, MMM-type algorithms, constant potential
simulations, dielectric interfaces, â€¦), hydrodynamic interactions
(:ref:`DPD<Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD)>`, :ref:`Lattice Boltzmann`),
and :ref:`magnetic interactions<Magnetostatics / Dipolar interactions>`, only
to name a few.  It is designed to exploit the capabilities of parallel
computational environments.  The program is being continuously extended to keep
the pace with current developments both in the algorithms and software.

The kernel of |es| is written in C++ with computational efficiency in mind.
Interaction between the user and the simulation engine is provided via a
*Python scripting interface*. This enables setup of arbitrarily complex systems
which users might want to simulate in future, as well as modifying simulation
parameters during runtime.

.. _Guiding principles:

Guiding principles
------------------

|es| is a tool for performing computer simulation and this user guide describes
how to use this tool. However, it should be borne in mind that being able to
operate a tool is not sufficient to obtain physically meaningful results. It is
always the responsibility of the user to understand the principles behind the
model, simulation and analysis methods he or she is using.

It is expected that the users of |es| and readers of this user guide have a
thorough understanding of simulation methods and algorithms they are planning
to use. They should have passed a basic course on molecular simulations or read
one of the renown textbooks, :cite:`frenkel02b`. It is not necessary to
understand everything that is contained in |es|, but it is inevitable to
understand all methods that you want to use. Using the program as a black box
without proper understanding of the background will most probably result in
wasted user and computer time with no useful output.

To enable future extensions, the functionality of the program is kept as
general as possible. It is modularized, so that extensions to some parts of the
program (implementing a new potential) can be done by modifying or adding only
few files, leaving most of the code untouched.

To facilitate the understanding and the extensibility, much emphasis is put on
readability of the code. Hard-coded assembler loops are generally avoided in
hope that the overhead in computer time will be more than compensated for by
saving much of the user time while trying to understand what the code is
supposed to do.

Hand-in-hand with the extensibility and readability of the code comes the
flexibility of the whole program. On the one hand, it is provided by the
generalized functionality of its parts, avoiding highly specialized functions.
An example can be the implementation of the Generic Lennard-Jones potential
described in section :ref:`Generic Lennard-Jones interaction` where the user
can change all available parameters. Where possible, default values are
avoided, providing the user with the possibility of choice. |es| cannot be
aware whether your particles are representing atoms or billiard balls, so it
cannot check if the chosen parameters make sense and it is the user's
responsibility to make sure they do. In fact, |es| can be used to play billiard
(see the sample script in :file:`samples/billiard.py`)!

On the other hand, flexibility of |es| stems from the employment of a scripting
language at the steering level. Apart from the ability to modify the simulation
and system parameters at runtime, many simple tasks which are not
computationally critical can be implemented at this level, without even
touching the C++-kernel. For example, simple problem-specific analysis routines
can be implemented in this way and made interact with the simulation core.
Another example of the program's flexibility is the possibility to integrate
system setup, simulation and analysis in one single control script. |es|
provides commands to create particles and set up interactions between them.
Capping of forces helps prevent system blow-up when initially some particles
are placed on top of each other. Using the Python interface, one can simulate
the randomly set-up system with capped forces, interactively check whether it
is safe to remove the cap and switch on the full interactions and then perform
the actual productive simulation.

.. _Basic program structure:

Basic program structure
-----------------------

As already mentioned, |es| consists of two components. The simulation engine is
written in C and C++ for the sake of computational efficiency. The steering or
control level is interfaced to the kernel via an interpreter of Python
scripting languages.

The kernel performs all computationally demanding tasks. Before all,
integration of Newton's equations of motion, including calculation of energies
and forces. It also takes care of internal organization of data, storing the
data about particles, communication between different processors or cells of
the cell-system. The kernel is modularized so that basic functions are accessed
via a set of well-defined lean interfaces, hiding the details of the complex
numerical algorithms.

The scripting interface (Python) is used to setup the system (particles,
boundary conditions, interactions, ...), control the simulation, run analysis,
and store and load results. The user has at hand the full readability and
functionality of the scripting language.  For instance, it is possible to use
the SciPy package for analysis and PyPlot for plotting. With a certain overhead
in efficiency, it can also be used to reject/accept new configurations in
combined MD/MC schemes.  In principle, any parameter which is accessible from
the scripting level can be changed at any moment of runtime. In this way
methods like thermodynamic integration become readily accessible.

The focus of the user guide is documenting the scripting interface, its
behavior and use in the simulation. It only describes certain technical details
of implementation which are necessary for understanding how the script
interface works. Technical documentation of the code and program structure is
contained in the `online wiki <https://github.com/espressomd/espresso/wiki>`_.

.. _Basic python simulation script:

Basic python simulation script
------------------------------

In this section, a brief overview is given over the most important components
of the Python interface. Their usage is illustrated by short examples, which
can be put together to a demo script.

.. rubric:: Imports

As usual, the Python script starts by importing the necessary modules.  The
|es| interface is contained in the :mod:`espressomd` Python module, which needs to be
imported, before anything related can be done. ::

    import espressomd

This should be followed by further necessary imports of the example at hand: ::

    from espressomd.interactions import HarmonicBond
    from espressomd.electrostatics import P3M

.. rubric:: espressomd.System

Access to the simulation system is provided via the :class:`~espressomd.system.System` class. As a
first step, an instance of this class needs to be created. ::

    system = espressomd.System(box_l=[10, 10, 10])

Note that only one instance of the System class can be created due to
limitations in the simulation core. :ref:`Properties of the System
class<Setting global variables in Python>` are used to access the parameters
concerning the simulation system such as box geometry, time step or :ref:`cell-system<Cellsystems>`: ::

    print("The box dimensions are {}".format(system.box_l))
    system.time_step = 0.01
    system.cell_system.skin = 0.4

.. rubric:: Particles

The particles in the simulation are accessed via ``system.part``, an instance of the :class:`~espressomd.particle_data.ParticleList` class. Use
the ``add`` method to :ref:`create new particles<Adding particles>`: ::

    system.part.add(id=0, pos=[1.0, 1.0, 1.0], type=0)
    system.part.add(id=1, pos=[1.0, 1.0, 2.0], type=0)

Individual particles can be retrieved by their numerical id using angular
brackets::

    system.part[1].pos = [1.0, 1.0, 2.0]

It is also possible to :ref:`loop<Iterating over particles and pairs of
particles>` over all particles::

    for p in system.part:
        print("Particle id {}, type {}".format(p.id, p.type))

An individual particle is represented by an instance of :class:`~espressomd.particle_data.ParticleHandle`.
The properties of the particle are implemented as Python
properties. ::

    particle = system.part[0]
    particle.type = 0
    print("Position of particle 0: {}".format(particle.pos))

:ref:`Properties of several particles<Interacting with groups of particles>`
can be accessed by using Python slices: ::

    positions = system.part[:].pos

.. rubric:: Interactions

In |es|, interactions between particles usually fall in three categories:

-  :ref:`Non-bonded interactions` are short-ranged interactions between *all*
   pairs of particles of specified types. An example is the
   Lennard-Jones interaction mimicking overlap repulsion and van-der-Waals attraction.

-  :ref:`Bonded interactions` act only between two specific particles. An
   example is the harmonic bond between adjacent particles in a polymer
   chain.

-  Long-range interactions act between all particles with specific
   properties in the entire system. An example is the :ref:`Coulomb
   interaction<Electrostatics>`.

.. rubric:: Non-bonded interaction

Non-bonded interactions are represented as subclasses of
:class:`~espressomd.interactions.NonBondedInteraction`, e.g.
:class:`~espressomd.interactions.LennardJonesInteraction`.
Instances of these classes for a given pair of particle types are accessed via
the non_bonded_inter attribute of the System class. This sets up a Lennard-Jones
interaction between all particles of type 0 with the given parameters: ::

    system.non_bonded_inter[0, 0].lennard_jones.set_params(
        epsilon=1, sigma=1, cutoff=5.0, shift="auto")

.. rubric:: Bonded interaction

Next, we add another pair of particles with a different type to later add
a :ref:`harmonic bond<Harmonic bond>` between them: ::

    system.part.add(id=2, pos=[7.0, 7.0, 7.0], type=1)
    system.part.add(id=3, pos=[7.0, 7.0, 8.0], type=1)

To set up a bonded interaction, first an instance of the appropriate
class is created with the desired parameters: ::

    harmonic = HarmonicBond(k=1.0, r_0=0.5)

Then, the bonded interaction is registered in the simulation core
by adding the instance to :attr:`~espressomd.system.System.bonded_inter`: ::

    system.bonded_inter.add(harmonic)

Finally, the bond can be added to particles using the :meth:`~espressomd.particle_data.ParticleHandle.add_bond()` method of
:class:`~espressomd.particle_data.ParticleHandle` with the instance of the bond class and the id of the bond
partner particle: ::

    system.part[2].add_bond((harmonic, 3))

.. rubric:: Charges

Now we want to setup a pair of charged particles treated by the P3M
electrostatics solver. We start by adding the particles: ::

    system.part.add(id=4, pos=[4.0, 1.0, 1.0], type=2, q=1.0)
    system.part.add(id=5, pos=[6.0, 1.0, 1.0], type=2, q=-1.0)

Long-range interactions and other methods that might be mutually exclusive
are treated as so-called *actors*. They are used by first creating an instance
of the desired actor::

    p3m = P3M(accuracy=1e-3, prefactor=1.0)

and then adding it to the system: ::

    print("Tuning p3m...")
    system.actors.add(p3m)

.. rubric:: Integration

So far we just *added* particles and interactions, but did not propagate the
system. This is done by the `integrator`.  It uses by default the velocity
Verlet algorithm and is already created by the system class. To perform an
integration step, just execute::

    system.integrator.run(1)

Usually, the system is propagated for a number of steps in a loop alongside
with some analysis. In this last snippet, the different energy contributions
of the system are printed: ::

    num_configs = 10
    num_steps = 1000

    for i in range(num_configs):
        system.integrator.run(num_steps)
        energy = system.analysis.energy()
        print("System time: {}".format(system.time))
        print("Energy of the LJ interaction: {}".format(energy["non_bonded"]))
        print("Energy of the harmonic bond: {}".format(energy["bonded"]))
        print("Energy of the Coulomb interaction: {}".format(energy["coulomb"]))

.. _On units:

On units
--------

What is probably one of the most confusing subjects for beginners of |es| is,
that |es| does not predefine any units. While most MD programs specify a set
of units, like, for example, that all lengths are measured in Ã…ngstrÃ¶m
or nanometers, times are measured in nano- or picoseconds and energies
are measured in :math:`\mathrm{kJ/mol}`, |es| does not do so.

Instead, the length-, time- and energy scales can be freely chosen by
the user. Once these three scales are fixed, all remaining units are
derived from these three basic choices.

The probably most important choice is the length scale. A length of
:math:`1.0` can mean a nanometer, an Ã…ngstrÃ¶m, or a kilometer -
depending on the physical system, that the user has in mind when he
writes his |es|-script. When creating particles that are intended to
represent a specific type of atoms, one will probably use a length scale
of Ã…ngstrÃ¶m. This would mean, that the parameter :math:`\sigma` of the
Lennard-Jones interaction between two atoms would be set to twice the
van-der-Waals radius of the atom in Ã…ngstrÃ¶m. Alternatively, one could
set :math:`\sigma` to :math:`2.0` and measure all lengths in multiples
of the van-der-Waals radius. When simulation colloidal particles, which
are usually of micrometer size, one will choose their diameter (or
radius) as basic length scale, which is much larger than the Ã…ngstrÃ¶m
scale used in atomistic simulations.

The second choice to be made is the energy scale. One can for example
choose to set the Lennard-Jones parameter :math:`\epsilon` to the energy
in :math:`\mathrm{kJ/mol}`. Then all energies will be measured in that
unit. Alternatively, one can choose to set it to :math:`1.0` and measure
everything in multiples of the van-der-Waals binding energy of the
respective particles.

The final choice is the time (or mass) scale. By default, |es| uses a reduced
mass of 1 for all particles, so that the mass unit is simply the mass of one particle.
Combined with the energy and length scale, this is sufficient to derive
the resulting time scale:

.. math::

    [\mathrm{time}] = [\mathrm{length}]\sqrt{\frac{[\mathrm{mass}]}{[\mathrm{energy}]}}

This means, that if you measure lengths in Ã…ngstrÃ¶m, energies in
:math:`k_B T` at 300K and masses in 39.95u, then your time scale is
:math:`\mathring{A} \sqrt{39.95u / k_B T} = 0.40\,\mathrm{ps}`.

On the other hand, if you want a particular time scale, then the mass
scale can be derived from the time, energy and length scales as

.. math::

    [\mathrm{mass}] = [\mathrm{energy}]\frac{[\mathrm{time}]^2}{[\mathrm{length}]^2}.

By activating the feature ``MASS``, you can specify particle masses in
the chosen unit system.

A special note is due regarding the temperature, which is coupled to the
energy scale by Boltzmann's constant. However, since |es| does not enforce a
particular unit system, we also don't know the numerical value of the
Boltzmann constant in the current unit system. Therefore, when
specifying the temperature of a thermostat, you actually do not define
the temperature, but the value of the thermal energy :math:`k_B T` in
the current unit system. For example, if you measure energy in units of
:math:`\mathrm{kJ/mol}` and your real temperature should be 300K, then
you need to set the thermostat's effective temperature to
:math:`k_B 300\, K \mathrm{mol / kJ} = 2.494`.

As long as one remains within the same unit system throughout the whole
|es|-script, there should be no problems.

Available simulation methods
----------------------------

|es| provides a number of useful methods. The following table shows the
various methods as well as their status. The table distinguishes between
the state of the development of a certain feature and the state of its
use. We distinguish between five levels:

**Core**
    means that the method is part of the core of |es|, and that it is
    extensively developed and used by many people.

**Good**
    means that the method is developed and used by independent people
    from different groups.

**Group**
    means that the method is developed and used in one group.

**Single**
    means that the method is developed and used by one person only.

**None**
    means that the method is developed and used by nobody.

**Experimental**
    means that the method might have side effects.

In the "Tested" column, we note whether there is an integration test for the method.

If you believe that the status of a certain method is wrong, please
report so to the developers.

Intended interface compatibility between ESPResSo versions
----------------------------------------------------------

We use the following versioning scheme:
major.minor.patch_level

With regards to the stability of the Python interface, we plan the following guidelines:

  * patch_level: The Python interface will not change, if only the patch_level number is different. Example: 4.0.0 -> 4.0.1.

  * minor: There will be no silent interface changes between two versions with different minor numbers. I.e., a simulation script will not silently produce different results with the new version. The interface can, however, be extended. In important cases, the interface can change in such a way that using the old interface produces a clear error message and the simulation is terminated. Example: 4.0.1 -> 4.1.0

  * major: No guarantees are made for a transition between major versions. Example 4.1.2 -> 5.0.

  * No guarantees are made with regards to the development branch on GitHub.

  * No guarantees are made with respect to the C++ bindings in the simulation core.
