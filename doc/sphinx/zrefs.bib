  abstract = {In the molecular dynamics simulation method for fluids, the equations
	of motion for a collection of particles in a fixed volume are solved
	numerically. The energy, volume, and number of particles are constant
	for a particular simulation, and it is assumed that time averages
	of properties of the simulated fluid are equal to microcanonical
	ensemble averages of the same properties. In some situations, it
	is desirable to perform simulations of a fluid for particular values
	of temperature and/or pressure or under conditions in which the energy
	and volume of the fluid can fluctuate. This paper proposes and discusses
	three methods for performing molecular dynamics simulations under
	conditions of constant temperature and/or pressure, rather than constant
	energy and volume. For these three methods, it is shown that time
	averages of properties of the simulated fluid are equal to averages
	over the isoenthalpic-isobaric, canonical, and isothermal-isobaric
	ensembles. Each method is a way of describing the dynamics of a certain
	number of particles in a volume element of a fluid while taking into
	account the influence of surrounding particles in changing the energy
	and/or density of the simulated volume element. The influence of
	the surroundings is taken into account without introducing unwanted
	surface effects. Examples of situations where these methods may be
	useful are discussed.},

  abstract = {We introduce a regularization procedure to define electrostatic energies
	and forces in a slab system of thickness h that is periodic in two
	dimensions and carries a net charge. The regularization corresponds
	to a neutralization of the system by two charged walls and can be
	viewed as the extension to the two-dimensional (2D)+h geometry of
	the neutralization by a homogeneous background in the standard three-dimensional
	Ewald method. The energies and forces can be computed efficiently
	by using advanced methods for systems with 2D periodicity, such as
	MMM2D or P3M-ELC, or by introducing a simple background-charge correction
	to the Yeh???Berkowitz approach of slab systems. The results are
	checked against direct lattice sum calculations on simple systems.
	We show, in particular, that the Madelung energy of a 2D square charge
	lattice in a uniform compensating background is correctly reproduced
	to high accuracy. A molecular dynamics simulation of a sodium ion
	close to an air-water interface is performed to demonstrate that
	the method does indeed provide consistent long-range electrostatics.
	The mean force on the ion reduces at large distances to the image-charge
	interaction predicted by macroscopic electrostatics. This result
	is used to determine precisely the position of the macroscopic dielectric
	interface with respect to the true molecular surface},

  abstract = {Using molecular dynamics simulations in which we take counterions
	explicitly into account, we study the behavior of a dilute solution
	of strongly charged polyelectrolytes in poor solvents. We focus on
	the chain conformational properties under conditions in which chain-chain
	interactions can be neglected but the counterion concentration remains
	finite. We investigate the conformations with regard to the parameters
	chain length, Coulomb interaction strength, and solvent quality and
	explore in which regime the competition between short-range hydrophobic
	interactions and long-range Coulomb interactions leads to pearl-necklace-like
	structures. We observe that large number and size fluctuations in
	the pearls and strings lead to only small direct signatures in experimental
	observables like the single-chain form factor. Furthermore, we do
	not observe the predicted first-order collapse of the necklace into
	a globular structure when counterion condensation sets in. We will
	also show that the pearl-necklace regime is rather small for strongly
	charged polyelectrolytes at finite densities. Even small changes
	in the charge fraction of the chain can have a large impact on the
	conformation due to the delicate interplay between counterion distribution
	and chain conformation.},

  abstract = {{We present a PC-based multi-tau software correlator suitable for
	processing dynamic light-scattering data. The correlator is based
	on a simple algorithm that was developed with the graphical programming
	language LabVIEW, according to which the incoming data are processed
	on line without any storage on the hard disk. By use of a standard
	photon-counting unit, a National Instruments Model 6602-PCI timer-counter,
	and a 550-MHz Pentium III personal computer, correlation functions
	can be worked out in full real-time overtime scales of similar to5
	mus and in batch processing down to time scales of similar to 300
	ns. The latter limit is imposed by the speed of data transfer between
	the counter and the PC's memory and thus is prone to be progressively
	reduced with future technological development. Testing of the correlator
	and evaluation of its performances were carried out by use of dilute
	solutions of calibrated polystyrene spheres. Our results indicate
	that the correlation functions are determined with such precision
	that the corresponding particle diameters can be recovered to within
	an accuracy of a few percent rms. (C) 2001 Optical Society of America.}},

	of a physical system and hence are frequently calculated in computer
	simulations. For systems whose dynamics span a wide range of time,

	In this paper, we discuss the multiple-tau correlator method for
	the efficient calculation of accurate time correlation functions
	on the fly during computer simulations. The multiple-tau correlator
	is efficacious in terms of computational requirements and can be
	tuned to the desired level of accuracy. Further, we derive estimates
	for the error arising from the use of the multiple-tau correlator
	and extend it for use in the calculation of mean-square particle
	displacements and dynamic structure factors. The method described
	here, in hardware implementation, is routinely used in light scattering
	experiments but has not yet found widespread use in computer simulations.
