Features
========

This chapter describes the features that can be activated in |es|. Even if
possible, it is not recommended to activate all features, because this
will negatively effect |es| ’s performance.

Features can be activated in the configuration header ``myconfig.hpp`` (see
section :ref:`myconifg.hpp\: Activating and deactivating features`). To
activate ``FEATURE``, add the following line to the header file:

::

    #define FEATURE

General features
----------------

-  ``PARTIAL_PERIODIC`` By default, all coordinates in |es| are periodic. With
   ``PARTIAL_PERIODIC`` turned on, the |es| global variable ``periodic``
   controls the periodicity of the individual coordinates.

   .. note:: This slows the integrator down by around :math:`10-30\%`.

   .. seealso:: :ref:`Setting global variables in Python`

-  ``ELECTROSTATICS`` This enables the use of the various electrostatics algorithms, such as P3M.

   .. seealso:: :ref:`Coulomb interaction`

-  ``INTER_RF``

-  ``MMM1D_GPU``

-  ``EWALD_GPU``

-  ``_P3M_GPU_FLOAT``

-  ``_P3M_GPU_DOUBLE``

-  ``DIPOLES`` This activates the dipole-moment property of particles; In addition,
   the various magnetostatics algorithms, such as P3M are switched on.

   .. seealso:: :ref:`Coulomb interaction`

-  ``SCAFACOS_DIPOLES``

-  ``ROTATION`` Switch on rotational degrees of freedom for the particles, as well as
   the corresponding quaternion integrator. 
   
   .. seealso:: :ref:`Setting up particles`

   .. note:: 
      Note, that when the feature is activated, every particle has three
      additional degrees of freedom, which for example means that the
      kinetic energy changes at constant temperature is twice as large.

-  ``LANGEVIN_PER_PARTICLE`` Allows to choose the Langevin temperature and friction coefficient
   per particle.

-  ``ROTATIONAL_INERTIA``

-  ``EXTERNAL_FORCES`` Allows to define an arbitrary constant force for each particle
   individually. Also allows to fix individual coordinates of particles,
   keep them at a fixed position or within a plane.

-  ``CONSTRAINTS`` Turns on various spatial constraints such as spherical compartments
   or walls. This constraints interact with the particles through
   regular short ranged potentials such as the Lennard–Jones potential.
   See section for possible constraint forms.

-  ``MASS`` Allows particles to have individual masses. Note that some analysis
   procedures have not yet been adapted to take the masses into account
   correctly.

   .. seealso:: :attr:`espressomd.particle_data.ParticleHandle.mass`

-  ``EXCLUSIONS`` Allows to exclude specific short ranged interactions within
   molecules.

   .. seealso:: :attr:`espressomd.particle_data.ParticleHandle.exclude`

-  ``COMFORCE`` Allows to pull apart groups of particles

-  ``COMFIXED`` Allows to fix the center of mass of all particles of a certain type.

-  ``MOLFORCES``

-  ``BOND_CONSTRAINT`` Turns on the RATTLE integrator which allows for fixed lengths bonds
   between particles.

-  ``VIRTUAL_SITES_COM`` Virtual sites are particles, the position and velocity of which is
   not obtained by integrating equations of motion. Rather, they are
   placed using the position (and orientation) of other particles. The
   feature allows to place a virtual particle into the center of mass of
   a set of other particles.
   
   .. seealso:: :ref:`Virtual sites` 

-  ``VIRTUAL_SITES_RELATIVE`` Virtual sites are particles, the position and velocity of which is
   not obtained by integrating equations of motion. Rather, they are
   placed using the position (and orientation) of other particles. The
   feature allows for rigid arrangements of particles.

   .. seealso:: :ref:`Virtual sites` 

-  ``VIRTUAL_SITES_NO_VELOCITY``

   .. seealso:: :ref:`Virtual sites` 

-  ``VIRTUAL_SITES_THERMOSTAT``

   .. seealso:: :ref:`Virtual sites` 

-  ``THERMOSTAT_IGNORE_NON_VIRTUAL``

-  ``MODES``

-  ``METADYNAMICS``

-  ``CATALYTIC_REACTIONS`` Allows the user to define three particle types to be reactant,
   catalyzer, and product. Reactants get converted into products in the
   vicinity of a catalyst according to a used-defined reaction rate
   constant. It is also possible to set up a chemical equilibrium
   reaction between the reactants and products, with another rate
   constant. 
   
   .. seealso:: :ref:`Catalytic reaction`

-  ``OVERLAPPED``

-  ``COLLISION_DETECTION`` Allows particles to be bound on collision.

In addition, there are switches that enable additional features in the
integrator or thermostat:

   exponents and individual prefactors for the two terms.

looking directly at the code.
