   The information found in this version of the Developer's Guide is
   outdated.  Please see the section :ref:`getting_into_contact` and
   ask for advice if you plan to start working on |es|.

.. _getting_into_contact:

Getting into Contact
====================

The first thing that you should do when you want to start to participate
is to get into contact with the |es| developers. To do that, subscribe
to the developers’ mailing list at
http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/espressomd-devel and write a
short email to the list address ``espressomd-devel@nongnu.org`` where
you state your experience with simulations and programming and the
things that you would like to do in |es|. We do not bite, and we are
happy about anybody who wants to participate!

.. _development_environment:

Development Environment
=======================

.. _required_development_tools:

Required Development Tools
--------------------------

If you want to participate in the development of |es|, you will
require the following tools depending on what tasks you want to perform:

-  To be able to access the development version of |es|, you will need
   the distributed versioning control system Git [1]_. Section
   :ref:`git_repositories` contains documentation on how we employ
   git.

-  To build |es| from the development sources, you will need not too
   old versions of the “GNU autotools” (*i.e.* automake [2]_ and
   autoconf [3]_) installed on your system. Section
   :ref:`building_the_development_code` contains information on how to
   build the development code, section
   :ref:`build_system` contains details on how the
   build system works.

-  To be able to compile the User’s Guide or the Developer’s Guide, you
   will need a LaTeX-installation (all recent ones will do). For
   details, refer to chapter .

-  To compile the Doxygen code documentation, you will need to have the
   tool Doxygen\  [4]_.

All of these tools should be easy to install on most Unix operating
systems.

.. _building_the_development_code:

Building the Development Code
-----------------------------

-  Use ``bootstrap.sh`` before building the code.

-  Use configure with ``–enable-maintainer-mode``.

-  Possible targets of ``make``

   -  ``check``

   -  ``dist``

   -  ``doc``

   -  ``ug``

   -  ``dg``

   -  ``doxygen``

   -  ``tutorials``

   -  ``distcheck``

   -  ``clean``, ``distclean``

.. _git_repositories:

Git Repositories
----------------

-  Development Repository: https://github.com/espressomd/espresso

-  Code hosting at GNU Savannah
   https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/espressomd/

.. _jenkins_build_server:

Jenkins Build Server
--------------------

-  Jenkins build server

.. _build_system:

Build System
------------

The build system of |es| makes use of the GNU autotools suite
consisting of automake [5]_ and autoconf [6]_. If you want to use the
development source code of ESPResSo, you first need to install both of
these tools.

The central source files of the build system are the following:

-  ``configure.ac``

-  ``config/*.m4``

-  ``Makefile.am``

-  the different ``Makefile.am`` in the subdirectories

To change the behaviour of the build system, you have to modify any
these files.

.. _running_bootstrapsh:

Running ``bootstrap.sh``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The script ``bootstrap.sh`` in the top level source directory can be
used to run ``automake``, ``autoconf`` and the associated tools to
generate the ``configure`` script and the ``Makefile.in`` used during
compilation. Once ``bootstrap.sh``, the |es| development code can be
build and used like the release code.

.. _creating_a_distribution_package:

Creating a Distribution Package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As described in the User’s Guide, to create a ``.tar.gz`` distribution
file that contains all required files, you can simply run ``make dist``.
This will bundle all files and put them into an archive with the name
``espresso-version.tar.gz``.

Even better, you can also run ``make distcheck``. This will not only
create the distribution file, but it will also thoroughly check the
created distribution, *i.e.*\ it will try to

-  unpack the distro into a new directory

-  configure and build it (``configure``)

-  run the testsuite (``make check``)

-  install it into a new directory (``make install``)

-  uninstall it (``make uninstall``)

Whenever something goes wrong in these checks, it will give an error
message that describes the problem. When everything goes fine, you can
be relatively sure that you have a useful |es| distribution package.

In some cases, it might be necessary to pass some options to the run of
``configure`` done by ``make distcheck``>. To these ends, the
environment variable ``DISTCHECK_CONFIGURE_FLAGS`` can be set to the
required options.

Example
"""""""

::

    DISTCHECK_CONFIGURE_FLAGS="--without-mpi CPPFLAGS=\"-I /usr/include/tcl8.4\"" \
      make distcheck

.. _build_system_adding_new_files:

Adding New Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To add new files to |es| (like C source files or header files) you
need to do the following:

-  Add the files to the ``Makefile.am`` in the same directory

-  Run ``bootstrap.sh`` in the source directory

-  Check the distribution by using ``make distcheck``

-  Add the files to the Git repository

.. _testsuite:

Testsuite
---------

-  How to write tests?

-  How they are called (``runtest.sh``)

.. _documentation:

Documentation
=============

.. _users_guide:

User’s Guide
------------

The User’s Guide is written in LaTeX. The source files reside in the
subdirectory ``doc/ug/`` of the |es| sources. The master file is
``ug.tex``, each chapter is contained in its own source file.

.. _general_issues:

General issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Other than usual, in the UG’s ``.tex``-files, the underscore
   character “\_” is a normal character in most cases, *i.e.* it can be
   used unquoted. Unfortunately, however, this makes it impossible to
   use “\_” in LaTeX-labels (don’t ask me why!).

-  Headings should start with a capital letter and continue with
   lower-case letters (“First steps” and *not* “First Steps”).

-  Use the “-ing” form in headings, *i.e.*\ “Setting up particles”
   instead of “Particle setup” or the like.

-  To see which parts of the User’s guide need to be fixed or which
   documentation is missing, there is a ``\todo``-command where one can
   put notes about what remains to be done. In the release version, the
   boxes are disabled so that they do not disturb the users. They can be
   turned on by commenting out the appropriate line in ``ug.tex``:

   ::

       %% For building the distribution docs, disable todo boxes.
       %\usepackage[disable]{todonotes}
       \usepackage{todonotes}

.. _building_the_users_guide:

Building the User’s Guide
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  To build the User’s Guide, you need to have a LaTeX-installation that
   includes BibTeX, PDFLaTeX and makeindex. All installations that I
   know of provide these tools.

-  There are two methods to build the User’s Guide:

   -  Use ``make ug`` from the build directory to build it. This will
      automatically generate the |es| quick reference and call latex,
      bibtex and makeindex as required.

   -  Use ``perl latexmk`` from the source directory. This will
      basically do the same, however, it will *not* automatically update
      the quick reference. The advantage of this method is, that you can
      use all of ``latexmk``\ ’s nice features, such as ``-pvc``. You
      can always rebuild the quick reference manually by calling

      ::

          awk -f assemble_quickref.awk > quickref.inp
              

.. _user_guide_adding_new_files:

Adding New Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To add new LaTeX-files to the User’s Guide, you need to modify

-  ``ug.tex``: add an appropriate include command near the end of the
   file

-  ``Makefile.am``: add the file to the variable ``ug_TEXFILES``.

.. _additional_environments_and_commands:

Additional Environments and Commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To maintain a consistent layout, a number of environments and commands
have been defined that should be used where applicable.

-  For the description of |es|’s Tcl-commands, read
   :ref:`documentation_of_tcl_commands`.

-  The name of |es| should be set via the command ``|es|``.

-  The strings “*i.e.*”, “*e.g.*” and “*et al.*” should be set via
   ``\ie``, ``\eg`` and ``\etal``.

-  For short pieces of code that can be displayed inline, use
   ``\codebox{``\ *text*\ ``}`` or ``\verb!``\ *text*\ ``!``

-  For longer code pieces or the syntax decription of non-Tcl commands,
   the environment ``code`` exists:

   ::

       \begin{code}
         ...
       \end{code}

   Note that this is *not* a verbatim environment, *i.e.*\ it will
   evaluate LaTeX-commands that are used inside. Therefore, the
   characters ``\``, ``{`` and ``}`` need to be quoted with backslashes
   inside the environment! Also, the underscore character “\_” needs to
   be quoted like ``\_``. On the other hand, it is possible to use other
   layout commands (like ``\textit``) inside.

-  For pieces of Tcl-code that make extensive use of ``{`` and ``}``, a
   verbatim environment ``tclcode`` exists:

   ::

       \begin{tclcode}
        ...
       \end{tclcode}


.. _documentation_of_tcl_commands:

Documentation of Tcl commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _formal_syntax_definition:

Formal Syntax Definition
""""""""""""""""""""""""

All |es|-commands have to be documented in the User’s Guide.

The command ``\newescommand[``\ *label*\ ``]{``\ *command*\ ``}`` should
be used at the beginning of a command description to generate a label
``es:``\ *command* and create appropriate index entries. The optional
argument *label* is only required, when *command* contains an underscore
character “\_”. In that case, a label ``es:``\ *label* is generated that
should not contain an underscore character.

For the *formal syntax definition*, you have to use the environments
``essyntax`` or ``essyntax*``. Both will generate the headings *Syntax*
and *Description*. ``essyntax`` will furthermore copy the syntax
definition to the quick reference guide. For an example, look at the
documentation of the ``part`` command in the file ``part.tex``. Inside
the ``essyntax`` environment, you have to use the following commands for
typesetting the definition:

-  ``\variant{``\ *number*\ ``}`` to typeset the label of a command
   variant

-  ``\var{``\ *name*\ ``}`` to typeset a variable argument. Note, that
   the argument is typeset in math mode. This means, that you can use
   “\_” to denote a subscript.

-  ``\keyword{``\ *text*\ ``}`` or ``\lit{``\ *text*\ ``}`` to typeset
   keywords or literals.

-  ``\opt{``\ *text*\ ``}`` to typeset optional arguments. Note that
   usually, the text inside the ``opt`` command will not be wrapped. If
   the optional argument is pretty long and needs to be wrapped, use
   ``\optlong``.

-  ``\optlong{``\ *text*\ ``}`` to typeset long optional argument
   blocks.

-  ``\alt{``\ *alt1* ``\asep`` *alt2* ``\asep`` *alt3* …\ ``}`` to
   typeset alternatives.

-  ``\feature{``\ *feature*\ ``}`` to typeset when a *feature* is
   referred to.

-  ``\require{``\ *number*\ ``}{``\ *text*\ ``}`` to typeset *text* to
   show that it requires certain features of |es|. *number* denotes
   the marking that is shown next to *text*. When this command is used,
   you also have to use the ``features``-environment (see below) at the
   end of the ``essyntax`` environment, where all of the *number*\ s
   used are explained.

-  The environment ``features`` to typeset which features are required
   by the Tcl-command. Inside the environment, each feature should be
   declared via the command
   ``\required[``\ *number*\ ``]{``\ *feature*\ ``}``, where the
   optional argument *number* is the number used above and *feature* is
   the feature in capital letters.

The formal syntax definition should be as simple and as readable as
possible, as it will be what a user references to. Avoid very long
definitions and constructs like nested alternatives and options. In
those cases, prefer to split the syntax definition into several variants
instead of writing it in a single, complicated definition.

Example
"""""""

::

    \begin{essyntax}

    \variant{5} constraint pore 
      center \var{c_x} \var{c_y} \var{c_z}

.. _description:

Description
"""""""""""

In the description, you should use all of the above typesetting commands
when you refer to them in the text. In particular, every variable
argument introduced via the ``\var``-command in the definition has to be
explained in detail:

-  state explicitly the *type* of the argument (integer, float, string,
   Tcl-list)

-  explain the meaning of the argument

If the command has a number of different options, *i.e.*\ independent,
optional arguments, they can be described in the *arguments*
environment:

::

    \begin{arguments}
      \item[<arg1>] <description of arg1>
      \item[<arg2>] <description of arg2>
      ...
    \end{arguments}

The environment will generate the subheading *Arguments* and nicely
format the descriptions.

Example
"""""""

::

    \begin{arguments}
      \item[\opt{\alt{short \asep verbose}}] Specify, whether the output is
        in a human-readable, but somewhat longer format (\keyword{verbose}),
        or in a more compact form (\keyword{short}). The default is
        \keyword{verbose}.
      
      \item[\opt{\alt{folded \asep absolute}}] Specify whether the particle
        positions are written in absolute coordinates (\keyword{absolute})

.. _doxygen_code_documentation:

Doxygen Code Documentation
--------------------------

The documentation of each function should contain a short description,
if necessary a more detailed description and a description for the
return value and parameters.

Look at the documentation of existing files and functions to get a
feeling how it should be!

Doxygen is able to understand simple LaTeX and HTML commands as well as
some special command in order to give the documentation a nice structure
and to make it more readable. In the following list you find a short
description of the most common commands we need:

-  | ``\anchor`` *name* *description*
   | Create an anchor to which you can refer using the ``\ref`` command.

-  | ``\ref`` *name* ``["``\ *text*\ ``"]``
   | Insert a link to another object in the documentation (*e.g.*\ an
     anchor).

-  | ``<a href="http://www.your_url.html">title</a>``
   | Link to an external HTML source.

-  | ``\file`` *name* *description*
   | Special anchor for a file.

-  | ``\image html`` *image*
   | Include a picture. The picture file should reside in the subdir
     ``doc/doxygen/figs``. Do not use the HTML ``<img>``-tag to include
     pictures, as doxygen will not copy the pictures into the
     documentation.

-  | ``<ul> <li>List entry 1</li> <li>List entry 2</li></ul>``
   | Creates a list in the documentation.

-  | ``\param`` *name* *description*
   | Document the parameter of a function.

-  | ``\return`` *decription*
   | Document the return value of a function.

==================

This chapter provides some hints on how to extend |es|. It is not
exhaustive, so for major changes the best documentation are the other
developers.

.. _adding_global_variables:

Adding Global Variables
-----------------------

Global variables are the simplest way to communicate values between the
Tcl script and the C simulation code. To make a C variable available to
Tcl, declare the variable ``extern`` in a header file and include in
``global.c``. Then add a new line to the definition of the constant data
structure ``fields`` at the beginning of the file ``global.c``. For
details on the entries, see the definition of ``Datafield`` in
``global.h``). Basically you have to declare *where* the variable is
stored, *which type* (INT or DOUBLE) it has and *how many* elements. A
callback procedure can be provided which checks if the given value is
valid and stores it. It is also responsible for dispatching the new
value to the other compute nodes, if necessary. The easiest way to do
that is by using ``mpi_bcast_parameter``, which will transfer the value
to the other nodes. A simple example is ``box_l`` with the callback
procedure ``boxl_callback``. For ``mpi_bcast_parameter`` to work, it is
necessary that they occur in the list of constant definitions at the
beginning of ``global.h``. So please keep this list in sync!

.. _adding_new_bonded_interactions:

Adding New Bonded Interactions
------------------------------

Every interaction resides in its own source file. A simple example for a
bonded interaction is the FENE bond in ``fene.h``. The data structures,
however, reside in ``interaction_data.h``. The bonded interactions are
all stored in a union, ``Bonded_ia_parameters``. For a new interaction,
just add another struct. Each bonded interaction is assigned a type
number, which has the form ``BONDED_IA_*``, *e.g.*\ ``BONDED_IA_FENE``.
The new interaction also has to have such a *unique* number.

After the setup of the necessary data structures in
``interaction_data.h``, write the source file, something like
``new_interaction.h``. You may want to use ``fene.h`` as a template
file. Typically, you will have to define the following procedures:

-  ::

       int *_set_params(int bond_type, ...)

   This function is used to define the parameters of a bonded
   interaction. ``bond_type`` is the bond type number from the inter
   command, and not one of the ``BONDED_*``. It is rather an index to
   the ``bonded_ia_params`` array. ``make_bond_type_exist`` makes sure
   that all bond types up the given type exist and are preinitialized
   with ``BONDED_IA_NONE``, *i.e.*\ are empty bond types. Therefore fill
   ``bonded_ia_params[bond_type]`` with the parameters for your
   interaction type.

-  ::

       int calc_*_force(Particle *p1, Particle *p2,..., 
                        Bonded_ia_parameters *iaparams, 
                        double dx[3], double force[3], ...)

   This routine calculate the force between the particles. ``ia_params``
   represents the parameters to use for this bond, ``dx`` represents the
   vector pointing from particle 2 to particle 1. The force on particle
   1 is placed in the force vector (and *not* added to it). The force on
   particle 2 is obtained from Newton’s law. For many body interactions,
   just add more particles in the beginning, and return the forces on
   particles 1 to N-1. Again the force on particle N is obtained from
   Newton’s law. The procedure should return 0 except when the bond is
   broken, in which case 1 is returned.

-  ::

       int *_energy(Particle *p1, Particle *p2, ..., 
                    Bonded_ia_parameters *iaparams, 
                    double dx[3], double *_energy)

   This calculates the energy originating from this bond. The result is
   placed in the location ``_energy`` points to, ``ia_params`` and
   ``dx`` are the same as for the force calculation, and the return
   value is also the flag for a broken bond.

After the preparation of the header file, the bonded interaction has to
be linked with the rest of the code. In ``interaction_data.c``, most of
the work has to be done:

#. Add a name for the interaction to ``get_name_of_bonded_ia``.

#. In ``calc_maximal_cutoff``, add a case for the new interaction which
   makes sure that ``max_cut`` is larger than the interaction range of
   the new interaction, typically the bond length. This value is always
   used as calculated by ``calc_maximal_cutoff``, therefore it is not
   strictly necessary that the maximal interaction range is stored
   explicitly.

#. Add a print block for the new interaction to
   ``tclcommand_inter_print_bonded``. The print format should be such
   that the output can be used as input to inter, and defines the same
   bond type.

#. In ``tclcommand_inter_parse_bonded``, add a parser for the
   parameters. See the section on parsing below.

#. Besides this, you have enter the force respectively the energy
   calculation routines in ``add_bonded_force``, ``add_bonded_energy``,
   ``add_bonded_virials`` and ``pressure_calc``. The pressure occurs
   twice, once for the parallelized isotropic pressure and once for the
   tensorial pressure calculation. For pair forces, the pressure is
   calculated using the virials, for many body interactions currently no
   pressure is calculated.

After the new bonded interaction works properly, it would be a good idea
to add a testcase to the testsuite, so that changes breaking your
interaction can be detected early.

.. _adding_new_nonbonded_interactions:

Adding New Nonbonded Interactions
---------------------------------

Writing nonbonded interactions is similar to writing nonbonded
interactions. Again we start with ``interaction_data.h``, where the
parameter structure has to be set up. Just add your parameters *with
reasonable names* to ``IA_parameters``. Note that there must be a
setting for the parameters which disables the interaction.

Now write the header file for the interaction. This time ``ljcos.h`` may
be a good example. The needed routines are

-  ::

       int print*IAToResult(Tcl_Interp *interp, int i, int j)

   writes out the interaction parameters between particles of type ``i``
   and ``j`` to the interpreters result such that the result can be fed
   into the ``inter`` command again to obtain the same interaction. The
   ``IA_parameters`` pointer can be obtained conveniently via
   ``get_ia_param(i,j)``.

-  ::

       int *_parser(Tcl_Interp * interp, int part_type_a, int part_type_b, 
                    int argc, char ** argv)

   parses the command line given by ``argc`` and ``argv`` for the
   parameters needed for the interaction, and writes them to the
   ``IA_parameters`` for types ``part_type_a`` and ``part_type_b``. For
   details on writing the parser, see below. The routine returns 0 on
   errors and otherwise the number of parameters that were read from the
   command line.

-  ::

       void add_*_pair_force(Particle *p1, Particle *p2, 
                             IA_parameters *ia_params, 
                             double d[3], double dist2, double dist, 
                             double force[3])
       double *_pair_energy(Particle *p1, Particle *p2, 
                            IA_parameters *ia_params, 
                            double d[3], double dist2, double dist)

   are the routines to compute the force respectively the energy.
   ``ia_params`` gives the interaction parameters for the particle types
   of particles ``p1`` and ``p2``, ``d`` gives the vector from particle
   2 to particle 1, ``dist`` its length and ``dist2`` its squared
   length. The last three parameters can be chosen on demand. Note that
   unlike in the bonded case, the force routine is called ``add_*``,
   *i.e.*\ the force has to be *added* to force. The ``*_pair_energy``
   routine simply returns the energy directly instead of the pointer
   approach of the bonded interactions.

Change ``interaction_data.c`` as follows (most changes are pretty much
the same for all potentials):

#. modify ``initialize_ia_params`` and ``copy_ia_params`` to take care
   of the additional parameters needed for your potential.

#. ``checkIfParticlesInteract`` has to be modified to also check for the
   no interaction condition for the new interaction (typically zero
   cutoff).

#. ``calc_maximal_cutoff`` has to modified such that ``max_cut`` is
   larger than the maximal cutoff your interaction needs. Again, the
   code always uses the result from this function, therefore the cutoff
   does not have to be stored explicitly in the interaction parameters.

#. add your ``print*IAToResult`` routine to
   ``tclprint_to_result_NonbondedIA``.

#. add the ``*_parser`` routine to ``tclcommand_inter_parse_bonded``.

After this, add the force calculation to ``add_non_bonded_pair_force``,
``add_non_bonded_pair_virials`` and ``pressure_calc``, and the energy
calculation to ``add_non_bonded_pair_energy``.

After the new non-bonded interaction works properly, it would be a good
idea to add a testcase to the testsuite, so that changes breaking your
interaction can be detected early.

Tcl I/O - Parsing and Printing

-  ``Tcl_GetDouble/Int ...``

-  ``Tcl_PrintDouble/Int`` (take care of number of arguments)

-  ``TCL_INTEGER_SPACE`` ...

.. _particle_data_organization:

Particle Data Organization
--------------------------

The particle data organization is described in the Tcl command
cellsystem, its implementation is briefly described in ``cells.h`` and
``ghosts.h``. Here only some details on how to access the data is
assembled. Writing a new cellsystem almost always requires deep
interactions with the most low level parts of the code and cannot be
explained in detail here.

Typically, one has to access all real particles stored on this node, or
all ghosts. This is done via a loop similar to the following:

::

       Cell *cell;
       int c,i,np,cnt=0;
       Particle *part;
     
       for (c = 0; c < local_cells.n; c++) {
         cell = local_cells.cell[c];
         part = cell->part;
         np   = cell->n;
         for(i=0 ; i < np; i++) {
            do_something_with_particle(part[i]);
         }
       }

To access the ghosts instead of the real particles, use ``ghost_cells``
instead of ``local_cells``.

Another way to access particle data is via ``local_particles``. This
array has as index the particle identity, so that
``local_particles[25]`` will give you an pointer to the particle with
identity 25, or ``NULL``, if the particle is not stored on this node,
neither as ghost nor as real particle. Note that the ``local_particle``
array does not discriminate between ghosts and real particles. Its
primary use is for the calculation of the bonded interactions, where it
is used to efficiently determine the addresses of the bonding
partner(s).

The master node can add and remove particles via ``place_particle`` and
``remove_particle``, or change properties via ``set_particle_v`` etc.
This is the preferred way to handle particles, since it is
multiprocessor save.

However, some algorithms, especially new cellsystems, may force you to
operate locally on the particle data and shift them around manually.
Since the particle organization is pretty complex, there are additional
routines to move around particles between particle lists. The routines
exist in two versions, one indexed, and one unindexed. The indexed
version take care of the ``local_particles`` array, which for each
particle index tells where to find the particle on this node (or
``NULL`` if the particle is not stored on this node), while the
unindexed versions require you to take care of that yourself (for
example by calling ``update_local_particles``). The second way is much
faster if you do a lot of particle shifting. To move particles locally
from one cell to another, use ``move_indexed_particle`` or
``move_unindexed_particle``, never try to change something directly in
the lists, you will create a mess! Inserting particles locally is done
via ``append_indexed_particle`` or ``append_unindexed_particle``.

Besides the ``local_particles array``, which has to be up to date at any
time, there is a second array ``particle_node``, which is available on
the master node only outside of the integrator, *i.e.*\ in the Tcl
script evaluation phases. If ``particle_node`` is ``NULL``, you have to
call ``build_particle_node`` to rebuild it. For each particle identity
it contains the node that the particle is currently located on.

The proper cell for a particle is obtained via
``CellStructure::position_to_node``, which calculates for a given
position the node it belongs to, and
``CellStructure::position_to_cell``, which calculates the cell it
belongs to on this node, or ``NULL``, if the cell is from a different
node. However, you should normally not be bothered with this
information, as long as you stick to ``place_particle`` and the other
routines to modify particle data.

Writing a new cellsystem basically requires only to create the functions
listed in ``CellStructure``. The ``init`` function has to also setup the
communicators, which is the most complex part of writing a new
cellsystem and contains all the communication details. ``prepare_comm``
is a small wrapper for the most common operations. Otherwise just grep
for ``CELL_STRUCTURE_DOMDEC``, and add some appropriate code for your
cell system. Note, however, that each cell system has its specific part
of the code, where only this cellsystem does something strange and
unique, so here you are completely on your own. Good luck.

.. _errorhandling_for_developers:

Errorhandling for Developers
----------------------------

Developers should use the errorhandling mechanism whenever it is
possible to recover from an error such that continuing the simulation is
possible once the source of the error is removed, i. e. the bond is
removed or a parameter changed. For example, if due to excessive forces,
particles have been far out of their current node, |es| puts them into
one of the local cells. Since the position is unphysical anyways, it is
of no importance anymore, but now the user can place the particles anew
and perhaps decrease the time step such that the simulation can continue
without error. However, most often the recovery requires no special
action.

To issue a background error, call

::

    errtxt=runtime_error(length)

where length should be the maximal length of the error message (you can
use ``TCL_DOUBLE_SPACE`` rsp. ``TCL_INTEGER_SPACE`` to obtain space for
a double rsp. integer). The function returns a pointer to the current
end of the string in ``error_msg``. After doing so, you should use the
``ERROR_SPRINTF``-macro, which substitutes to a simple ``sprintf``, so
that your errormessage will automatically be added to the
“runtime-errors resolved”-page. Please make sure that you give each of
your errors an unique 3-digit errorcode (for already used errorcodes
have a look at the “runtime-errors resolved”-page), have the curled
braces around your message and the space at the end, otherwise the final
error message will look awful and will propably not automatically be
added to our error-page. Typically, this looks like this:

::

    if (some_error_code != OK) {
      char *errtxt = runtime_error(TCL_INTEGER_SPACE + 128);
      ERROR_SPRINTF(errtxt, "{error occured %d} ", some_error_code);
      recovery;
    }

If you have long loops during which runtime errors can occur, such as
the integrator loop, you should call ``check_runtime_errors`` from time
to time and exit the loop on errors. Note that this function requires
all nodes to call it synchronously.

In all cases, all Tcl commands should call ``mpi_gather_runtime_errors``
before exiting. You simply handover the result you were just about to
return. If the result was ``TCL_ERROR``, then
``mpi_gather_runtime_errors`` will keep the Tcl error message and
eventually append the background errors. If the result was ``TCL_OK``,
*i.e.*\ your function did not find an error, the result will be reset
(since |es| is in an undefined state, the result is meaningless), and
only the background errors are returned. Whenever a Tcl command returns,
instead of ``return TCL_OK/TCL_ERROR`` you should use

::

    return mpi_gather_runtime_errors(interp, TCL_OK/TCL_ERROR);
