/** \mainpage ESPResSo Code documentation

This is the code documentation of ESPResSo. It is primarily intended
for people that want to extend or just understand the C-code of
ESPResSo.

If you just have obtained a release of ESPResSo, and you are looking
for documentation on how to use ESPResSo, you might first want to have
a look at the User's Guide, which is to be found in \c doc/ug/ug.pdf
in the ESPResSo release.

If you want to start developing code for ESPResSo, you might first
want to have a look at the Developer's Guide (DG). You can find the
most recent version of the DG at the <a
href="http://espressomd.org/jenkins/job/ESPResSo/doclinks/2/">ESPResSo
homepage</a>. The DG explains

- how to obtain the development code
- what tools are required to develop the code
- how to get your modifications into the main code repository
- how the documentation is updated

\section entry Entry points to the C-code

The script is interpreted on one node, the master node, whereas the
other nodes wait for the master node to issue specific actions,
i. e. a client-server model is utilized. More details can be found in
\ref communication.h "communication.h". During the actual integration,
however, the communication is done synchronously.  For more details
see \ref integrate.c "integrate.c".
