@mainpage ESPResSo code documentation

This is the code documentation of ESPResSo. It is primarily intended
for people that want to extend or just understand the C++ core of
ESPResSo.

If you just have obtained a release of ESPResSo, and you are looking for
documentation on how to use the software, you might first want to have a look
at the User's Guide, which is available at <http://espressomd.org/html/doc/>.

If you want to start developing code for ESPResSo, you might first
want to have a look at the Developer's Guide on the GitHub wiki at
<https://github.com/espressomd/espresso/wiki>. The wiki explains:

- how to obtain the development code
- what tools are required to develop the code
- how to get your modifications into the main code repository
- how the documentation is updated

If you need to develop new features in the core, you can find detailed
instructions in the [Related Pages](pages.html).
