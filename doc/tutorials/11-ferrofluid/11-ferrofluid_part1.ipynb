    "Ferrofluids are colloidal suspensions of ferromagnetic single-domain particles in a liquid carrier. As the single particles contain only one magnetic domain, they can be seen as small permanent magnets. To prevent agglomeration of the particles, due to van-der-Waals or magnetic attraction, they are usually sterically or electrostatically stabilized (see <a href='#fig_1'>fig. 1</a>). Former is achieved by adsorption of long chain molecules onto the particle surface, latter by adsorption of charged coating particles. The size of the ferromagnetic particles are in the region of 10 nm. With the surfactant layer added they can reach a size of a few hundred nanometers. Have in mind that if we refer to the particle diameter $\\sigma$ we mean the diameter of the magnetic core plus two times the thickness of the surfactant layer.\n",
