    "\n",
    "Quantum mechanics gives us the most complete description of the world we can achieve.\n",
    "While the methods involve some degree of approximation, there are numerous approaches to performing quantum mechanical simulations.\n",
    "The most prominent one is probably density functional theory (DFT).\n",
    "Simulations at this level of accuracy are some of the most precise we can perform,\n",
    "allowing us to study complex chemical interactions and even bond-dynamics studies.\n",
    "Unfortunately, they are computationally demanding, and thus limited to small numbers of atoms and short time scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past decade, machine learning has been used extensively to address this problem.\n",
    "Beginning in 2008, scientists began using machine-learning models trained on small quantum mechanical simulations to perform large-scale atomistic studies with no loss in accuracy.\n",
    "The models work by computing energies and forces on individual atoms based on the local atomic environment, encoded in a chemical descriptor.\n",
    "Nowadays, this technique enables large-scale simulations with quantum mechanical accuracy ([Kozinsky et al.](https://doi.org/10.1145/3581784.3627041)).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different machine-learning models and dedicated open-source Python packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- MACE https://github.com/ACEsuit/mace\n",
    "- NequIP / allegro https://github.com/mir-group/nequip\n",
    "- Apax https://github.com/apax-hub/apax\n",
    "- DeepMD https://github.com/deepmodeling/deepmd-kit\n",
    "- TorchANI https://github.com/aiqm/torchani\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these has its own specialization and applications.\n",
    "In their infancy, using a trained machine-learned potential was challenging. \n",
    "It typically requires extensive re-training and, therefore, quantum mechanical simulations or complex active-learning routines where one iteratively improves model accuracy during a simulation.\n",
    "However, as of 2024, foundation models now exist.\n",
    "These models are trained on an extensive chemical space and have demonstrated to be stable on many material simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will focus on the [MACE-MP-0](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2401.00096) model. This model has been trained on the [materials project dataset](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4812323) and can accurately predict energies and forces for many organic and inorganic systems.\n",
    "The MACE-MP-0 model uses the state-of-the-art MACE equivariant message passing model architecture, more information for which is available in the lecture slides."

    "Most machine-learned potential framework operations through the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) Python package.\n",

    "The majority of ASE takes place within the `ase.Atoms` objects, which in turn are built from the `ase.Atom` objects (note the missing final 's').\n",
    "An `Atom` object contains information about a single atom in a configuration (an `Atoms` object),\n",
    "including its position, forces, species, and how interactions should be computed between its neighbours.\n",
    "These interactions are defined using `Calculators`, which take a whole `Atoms` object and return energies and forces on each atom.\n",
    "More information can be found in the ASE documentation: https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/atoms.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a part of this tutorial, we have extended ESPResSo to interface with ASE in such a way that it allows calculators to apply forces to atoms in a simulation box. \n",
    "In this case, we will focus solely on the machine-learned potentials.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you have created simulations from simple SMILES representations and were able to run geometry optimization and MD simulations with (almost) DFT accuracy. \n",
    "These approaches are not just theoretical, but highly practical. They can be used when a system requires a high degree of accuracy in its calculations, providing you with a reliable toolkit for your computational chemistry simulations."
