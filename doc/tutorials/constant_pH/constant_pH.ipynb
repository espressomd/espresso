    "\n",
    "The constant pH method [Reed1992](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.462145) is designed to simulate an acid-base ionization reaction at a given pH. It assumes that the simulated system is coupled to an implicit reservoir of $\\mathrm{H^+}$ ions but exchange of ions with this reservoir is not explicitly simulated. Therefore, the concentration of $\\mathrm{H^+}$ ions in the simulation box is not equal to the concentration of $\\mathrm{H^+}$ ions at the chosen pH. This may lead to artifacts when simulating interacting systems, especially at high of low pH values. Discussion of these artifacts is beyond the scope of this tutorial (see e.g. [Landsgesell2019](https://doi.org/10.1039/C8SM02085J) for further details).\n",

The neutralizing counterion is not necessarily an $\\mathrm{H^+}$ ion. Therefore, we give it a generic name $\\mathrm{B^+}$. In the reverse direction (from right to left), the chemical identity (particle type) of a randomly selected $\\mathrm{A}^{-}$ is changed to $\\mathrm{HA}$, and a randomly selected $\\mathrm{B}^+$ is deleted from the simulation box. The probability of proposing the  forward reaction step is $P_\\text{prop}=N_\\mathrm{HA}/N_0$, and probability of proposing the reverse step is $P_\\text{prop}=N_\\mathrm{A}/N_0$.

    "Up to now we did not discuss the chemical nature the neutralizer $\\mathrm{B^+}$. Due to the fact that we heavily coarse-grain and simulate both water and (most) $\\mathrm{H^+}$-ions implicitly, it is not obvious how to best interpret the $\\mathrm{B^+}$ chemically. \n",
    "Following is a discussion on how to interpret the $\\mathrm{B^+}$-ion for different systems and pH-values. The added salt is not relevant in this context, therefore we omit it from the discussion. \n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest case to consider is what happens if you add the acidic polymer to pure water ($\\mathrm{pH} = 7$). Some of the acid groups dissociate and release $\\mathrm{H^+}$ ions into the solution. The pH decreases to a value that depends on $\\mathrm{p}K_{\\mathrm{A}}$ and on the concentration of ionizable groups. Now, three ionic species are present in the solution: $\\mathrm{H^+}$, $\\mathrm{A^-}$, and $\\mathrm{OH^-}$. Because the reaction generates only one $\\mathrm{B^+}$ ion in the simulation box, we conclude that in this case the $\\mathrm{B^+}$ ions correspond to $\\mathrm{H^+}$ ions. The $\\mathrm{H^+}$ ions neutralize both the $\\mathrm{A^-}$ and the $\\mathrm{OH^-}$ ions. At acidic pH there are only very few $\\mathrm{OH^-}$ ions and nearly all $\\mathrm{H^+}$ ions act as a neutralizer for the $\\mathrm{A^-}$ ions. Therefore, the concentration of $\\mathrm{B^+}$ is very close to the concentration of $\\mathrm{H^+}$ in the real aqueous solution. Only very few $\\mathrm{OH^-}$ ions, and the $\\mathrm{H^+}$ ions needed to neutralize them, are missing in the simulation box, when compared to the real solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve a more acidic pH (with the same pK and polymer concentration), we need to add an acid to the system. We can do that by adding a strong acid, such as $\\mathrm{HCl}$ or $\\mathrm{HNO}_3$. We will denote this acid by a generic name $\\mathrm{HX}$ to emphasize that in general its anion can be different from the salt anion $\\mathrm{Cl^{-}}$. Now, there are 4 ionic species in the solution:  $\\mathrm{H^+}$, $\\mathrm{A^-}$, $\\mathrm{OH^-}$, and $\\mathrm{X^-}$ ions. By the same argument as before, we conclude that $\\mathrm{B^+}$ ions correspond to $\\mathrm{H^+}$ ions. The $\\mathrm{H^+}$ ions neutralize the $\\mathrm{A^-}$, $\\mathrm{OH^-}$, and the $\\mathrm{X^-}$ ions. Because the concentration of $\\mathrm{X^-}$ is not negligible anymore, the concentration of $\\mathrm{B^+}$ in the simulation box differs from the $\\mathrm{H^+}$ concentration in the real solution. Now, many more ions are missing in the simulation box, as compared to the real solution: Few $\\mathrm{OH^-}$ ions, many $\\mathrm{X^-}$ ions, and all the $\\mathrm{H^+}$ ions that neutralize them.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve a neutral pH we need to add some base to the system to neutralize the polymer.\n",
    "In the simplest case we add an alkali metal hydroxide, such as $\\mathrm{NaOH}$ or $\\mathrm{KOH}$, that we will generically denote as $\\mathrm{MOH}$. Now, there are 4 ionic species in the solution:  $\\mathrm{H^+}$, $\\mathrm{A^-}$, $\\mathrm{OH^-}$, and $\\mathrm{M^+}$. In such situation, we can not clearly attribute a specific chemical identity to the $\\mathrm{B^+}$ ions. However, only very few $\\mathrm{H^+}$ and $\\mathrm{OH^-}$ ions are present in the system at $\\mathrm{pH} = 7$. Therefore, we can make the approximation that at this pH, all $\\mathrm{A^-}$ are neutralized by the $\\mathrm{M^+}$ ions, and the $\\mathrm{B^+}$ correspond to $\\mathrm{M^+}$. Then, the concentration of $\\mathrm{B^+}$ also corresponds to the concentration of $\\mathrm{M^+}$ ions. Now, again only few ions are missing in the simulation box, as compared to the real solution: Few $\\mathrm{OH^-}$ ions, and few $\\mathrm{H^+}$ ions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve a basic pH we need to add even more base to the system to neutralize the polymer.\n",
    "Again, there are 4 ionic species in the solution:  $\\mathrm{H^+}$, $\\mathrm{A^-}$, $\\mathrm{OH^-}$, and $\\mathrm{M^+}$ and we can not clearly attribute a specific chemical identity to the $\\mathrm{B^+}$ ions. Because only very few $\\mathrm{H^+}$ ions should be present in the solution, we can make the approximation that at this pH, all $\\mathrm{A^-}$ ions are neutralized by the $\\mathrm{M^+}$ ions, and therefore $\\mathrm{B^+}$ ions in the simulation correspond to $\\mathrm{M^+}$ ions in the real solution. Because additional $\\mathrm{M^+}$ ions in the real solution neutralize the $\\mathrm{OH^-}$ ions, the concentration of $\\mathrm{B^+}$ does not correspond to the concentration of $\\mathrm{M^+}$ ions. Now, again many ions are missing in the simulation box, as compared to the real solution: Few $\\mathrm{H^+}$ ions, many $\\mathrm{OH^-}$ ions, and a comparable amount of the $\\mathrm{M^+}$ ions.\n",

    "To further illustrate this subject, we compare the concentration of the neutralizer ion $\\mathrm{B^+}$ calculated in the simulation with the expected number of ions of each species. At a given pH and pK we can calculate the expected degree of ionization from the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Then we apply the electroneutrality condition \n",
    "$$c_\\mathrm{A^-} + c_\\mathrm{OH^-} + c_\\mathrm{X^-} = c_\\mathrm{H^+} + c_\\mathrm{M^+}$$\n",
    "where we use either $c_\\mathrm{X^-}=0$ or $c_\\mathrm{M^+}=0$ because we always only add extra acid or base, but never both. Adding both would be equivalent to adding extra salt $\\mathrm{MX}$.\n",
    "We obtain the concentrations of $\\mathrm{OH^-}$ and $\\mathrm{H^+}$ from the input pH value, and substitute them to the electroneutrality equation to obtain\n",
    "$$\\alpha c_\\mathrm{acid} + 10^{-(\\mathrm{p}K_\\mathrm{w} - \\mathrm{pH})} + 10^{-\\mathrm{pH}} = c_\\mathrm{M^+} - c_\\mathrm{X^-}$$\n",

    "We see that the ionic strength in the simulation box significantly deviates from the ionic strength of the real solution only at high or low pH value. If the $\\mathrm{p}K_{\\mathrm{A}}$ value is sufficiently large, then the deviation at very low pH can also be neglected because then the polymer is uncharged in the region where the ionic strength is not correctly represented in the constant-pH simulation. At a high pH the ionic strength will have an effect on the weak acid, because then it is fully charged. The pH range in which the constant-pH method uses approximately the right ionic strength depends on salt concentration, weak acid concentration and the $\\mathrm{p}K_{\\mathrm{A}}$ value.
