    "The constant $\\mathrm{pH}$ method <a href='#[Reed1992]'>[Reed1992]</a> has been designed to simulate an acid-base ionization reaction at a given $\\mathrm{pH}$. It assumes that $\\mathrm{pH}$ in the system is constant, independent of the ionization degree.

If the number of blocks is small, then they are uncorrelated but the obtained error estimate has a high uncertainty. If the number of blocks is high, then they are too short to be uncorrelated, and the obtained error estimates are systematically lower than the correct value. Therefore, the method works well only if the sample size is much greater than the autocorrelation time, so that it can be divided into a sufficient number of mutually uncorrelated blocks."

    "### The Neutralizing Ion $\\mathrm{B^+}$\n",
    "Up to now we did not discuss the chemical nature the neutralizer $\\mathrm{B^+}$.\n",
    "It is not obvious how the chemical nature of the $\\mathrm{B^+}$ ion should be interpreted in a coarse-grained model, where water molecules and $\\mathrm{H^+}$ ions are not represented explicitly.\n",
    "Now, we address this issue using some specific examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the simplest case, if we add an acidic polymer to pure water that has $\\mathrm{pH} = 7$, some of the acid groups dissociate and release $\\mathrm{H^+}$ ions into the solution. The $\\mathrm{pH}$ decreases to a value that depends on $\\mathrm{p}K_{\\mathrm{A}}$ and on the concentration of ionizable groups. Now, three ionic species are present in the solution: $\\mathrm{H^+}$, $\\mathrm{A^-}$, and $\\mathrm{OH^-}$.  \n",
    "In this case the $\\mathrm{B^+}$ ions generated in our implementation of the reaction correspond to the $\\mathrm{H^+}$ ions. The $\\mathrm{H^+}$ act as the counter-ions, neutralizing both the $\\mathrm{A^-}$ and the $\\mathrm{OH^-}$ ions. At acidic $\\mathrm{pH}$ there are only very few $\\mathrm{OH^-}$ ions and nearly all $\\mathrm{H^+}$ ions act as neutralizer for the $\\mathrm{A^-}$ ions. Therefore, the concentration of $\\mathrm{B^+}$ is very close to the concentration of $\\mathrm{H^+}$ in the real aqueous solution. Only very few $\\mathrm{OH^-}$ ions, and the $\\mathrm{H^+}$ ions needed to neutralize them, are missing in the simulation box, when compared to the real solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve a more acidic $\\mathrm{pH}$ (with the same $\\mathrm{p}K_{\\mathrm{A}}$ and polymer concentration), we need to add an acid to the system. We can do that by adding a strong acid, such as $\\mathrm{HCl}$ or $\\mathrm{HNO}_3$. We will denote this acid by a generic name $\\mathrm{HX}$ to emphasize that in general its anion can be different from the salt anion $\\mathrm{Cl^{-}}$. Now, there are 4 ionic species in the solution:  $\\mathrm{H^+}$, $\\mathrm{A^-}$, $\\mathrm{OH^-}$, and $\\mathrm{X^-}$ ions. By the same argument as before, the $\\mathrm{B^+}$ ions again correspond to the $\\mathrm{H^+}$ ions. The $\\mathrm{H^+}$ ions neutralize the $\\mathrm{A^-}$, $\\mathrm{OH^-}$, and the $\\mathrm{X^-}$ ions. Because the concentration of $\\mathrm{X^-}$ is not negligible, the concentration of $\\mathrm{B^+}$ in the simulation box differs from the $\\mathrm{H^+}$ concentration in the real solution. Now, many more ions are missing in the simulation box, as compared to the real solution: Few $\\mathrm{OH^-}$ ions, many $\\mathrm{X^-}$ ions, and all the $\\mathrm{H^+}$ ions that neutralize them.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve a neutral $\\mathrm{pH}$ we need to add some base to the system to neutralize the polymer.\n",
    "In the simplest case we add an alkali metal hydroxide, such as $\\mathrm{NaOH}$ or $\\mathrm{KOH}$, that we will generically denote as $\\mathrm{MOH}$. Now, there are 4 ionic species in the solution:  $\\mathrm{H^+}$, $\\mathrm{A^-}$, $\\mathrm{OH^-}$, and $\\mathrm{M^+}$. In such situation, we can not clearly attribute a specific chemical identity to the $\\mathrm{B^+}$ ions. However, only very few $\\mathrm{H^+}$ and $\\mathrm{OH^-}$ ions are present in the system at $\\mathrm{pH} = 7$. Therefore, we can make the approximation that at this $\\mathrm{pH}$, all $\\mathrm{A^-}$ are neutralized by the $\\mathrm{M^+}$ ions, and the $\\mathrm{B^+}$ correspond to $\\mathrm{M^+}$. Then, the concentration of $\\mathrm{B^+}$ also corresponds to the concentration of $\\mathrm{M^+}$ ions. Now, again only few ions are missing in the simulation box, as compared to the real solution: Few $\\mathrm{OH^-}$ ions, and few $\\mathrm{H^+}$ ions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve a basic $\\mathrm{pH}$ we need to add even more base to the system to neutralize the polymer.\n",
    "Again, there are 4 ionic species in the solution:  $\\mathrm{H^+}$, $\\mathrm{A^-}$, $\\mathrm{OH^-}$, and $\\mathrm{M^+}$ and we can not clearly attribute a specific chemical identity to the $\\mathrm{B^+}$ ions. Because only very few $\\mathrm{H^+}$ ions should be present in the solution, we can make the approximation that at this $\\mathrm{pH}$, all $\\mathrm{A^-}$ ions are neutralized by the $\\mathrm{M^+}$ ions, and therefore $\\mathrm{B^+}$ ions in the simulation correspond to $\\mathrm{M^+}$ ions in the real solution. Because additional $\\mathrm{M^+}$ ions in the real solution neutralize the $\\mathrm{OH^-}$ ions, the concentration of $\\mathrm{B^+}$ does not correspond to the concentration of $\\mathrm{M^+}$ ions. Now, again many ions are missing in the simulation box, as compared to the real solution: Few $\\mathrm{H^+}$ ions, many $\\mathrm{OH^-}$ ions, and a comparable amount of the $\\mathrm{M^+}$ ions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To further illustrate this subject, we compare the concentration of the neutralizer ion $\\mathrm{B^+}$ calculated in the simulation with the expected number of ions of each species. At a given $\\mathrm{pH}$ and $\\mathrm{p}K_{\\mathrm{A}}$ we can calculate the expected degree of ionization from the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Then we apply the electroneutrality condition \n",
    "$$c_\\mathrm{A^-} + c_\\mathrm{OH^-} + c_\\mathrm{X^-} = c_\\mathrm{H^+} + c_\\mathrm{M^+}$$\n",
    "where we use either $c_\\mathrm{X^-}=0$ or $c_\\mathrm{M^+}=0$ because we always only add extra acid or base, but never both. Adding both would be equivalent to adding extra salt $\\mathrm{MX}$.\n",
    "We obtain the concentrations of $\\mathrm{OH^-}$ and $\\mathrm{H^+}$ from the input $\\mathrm{pH}$ value, and substitute them to the electroneutrality equation to obtain\n",
    "$$\\alpha c_\\mathrm{acid} + 10^{-(\\mathrm{p}K_{\\mathrm{w}} - \\mathrm{pH})} + 10^{-\\mathrm{pH}} = c_\\mathrm{M^+} - c_\\mathrm{X^-}$$\n",
    "Depending on whether the left-hand side of this equation is positive or negative we know whether we should add $\\mathrm{M^+}$ or $\\mathrm{X^-}$ ions."
