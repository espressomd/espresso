    "Ferrofluids are colloidal suspensions of ferromagnetic single-domain particles in a liquid carrier. As the single particles contain only one magnetic domain, they can be seen as small permanent magnets. To prevent agglomeration of the particles, due to van-der-Waals or magnetic attraction, they are usually sterically or electrostatically stabilized (see <a href='#fig_1'>figure 1</a>). The former is achieved by adsorption of long chain molecules onto the particle surface, the latter by adsorption of charged coating particles. The size of the ferromagnetic particles are in the region of 10 nm. With the surfactant layer added they can reach a size of a few hundred nanometers. Have in mind that if we refer to the particle diameter $\\sigma$ we mean the diameter of the magnetic core plus two times the thickness of the surfactant layer.\n",

    "Some of the liquid properties, like the viscosity, the phase behavior or the optical birefringence can be altered via an external magnetic field or simply the fluid can be guided by such an\n",

By default the boundary conditions of the system are set to conducting which means the dielectric constant is set to infinity for the surrounding medium. As we want to simulate a two dimensional system we additionally use the dipolar layer correction (DLC) (see Ref. <a href='#[2]'>[2]</a>). As we add <tt>DipolarP3M</tt> to our system as an actor, a tuning function is started automatically which tries to find the optimal parameters for Dipolar P3M and prints them to the screen. The last line of the output is the value of the tuned skin."
