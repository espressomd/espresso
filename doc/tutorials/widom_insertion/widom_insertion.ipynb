    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of Monte Carlo and Molecular Dynamic simulations offers many possibilities beyond using each technique solely on their own.\n",
    "In general, MD simulations are restricted to relatively small time scales and, depending on the modeled interactions, to rather small particle numbers as well.\n",
    "However, they have the advantage of computing collective particle movements with the correct dynamics.\n",
    "The time between two MD steps is bound by the fastest motion of the system of interest (for all-atom MD, those are atomic vibrations).\n",
    "\n",
    "MC simulations, on the other hand, do not have such limitations.\n",
    "Even nonphysical moves can be considered, still leading to results with correct thermodynamic properties.\n",
    "However, no valuable information of the system dynamics can be obtained.\n",
    "The combination of MD and MC moves allows us to mimic any ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will compute the excess chemical potential of a monovalent salt solution by using a combination of MD and MC techniques.\n",
    "For this purpose, you will learn about the Widom particle insertion method <a href='#[1]'>[1]</a> and how it can be used in ESPResSo.\n",
    "The chemical potential is important for simulating chemical equilibria and systems where particles can be exchanged with an external reservoir, which is too large to be simulated explicitly, or between two subsystems."

    "In a pure MD simulation, there is no direct way to access the chemical potential, since it is related to changes in the particle number that is typically fixed.\n",
    "In 1963, Widom proposed a MC scheme to measure the chemical potential in a system using trial particle insertions <a href='#[1]'>[1]</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chemical potential for species $\\alpha$ is defined as\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "  \\mu_{\\alpha} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial N_\\alpha} \\right)_{p,T,N_{\\beta\\neq\\alpha}} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial N_\\alpha}\\right)_{V,T,N_{\\beta\\neq\\alpha}} \\quad ,\\tag{1}\n",
    "  \\label{eq:chem_pot_def}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "and corresponds to the difference in the Helmholtz free energy $F$ or Gibbs free energy $G$ when adding or removing one particle in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The canonical partition function is defined as\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "  Z(N,V,T)=\\frac{V^N}{\\Lambda^{3N}N!} \\int_{\\left[0,1\\right]^{3N}}\\exp\\left(-\\beta U\\left(\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{s}^i\\right\\}\\right)\\right)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{s}^1\\ldots\\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{s}^N  \\quad ,\\tag{2}\n",
    "  \\label{eq:partition_function}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where V is the volume, $\\Lambda=h/\\sqrt{2\\pi m k_\\mathrm{B}T}$ the thermal wavelength, $\\beta$ the inverse temperature, $U$ the interaction potential and $\\boldsymbol{s}^i$ the rescaled (dimensionless) particle coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Helmholtz free energy $F$ can be computed from the partition function: $F=-k_BT\\ln\\left(Z(N,V,T)\\right)$.\n",
    "For sufficiently large N, the following relation approximates the chemical potential:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  \\mu & = -k_\\mathrm{B}T \\ln\\left(\\frac{Z(N+1,V,T)}{Z(N,V,T)}\\right) \\label{eq:mu_limit_largeN}\\\\\n",
    "      & = \\mu_\\textrm{ideal}+\\mu_\\textrm{ex} \\nonumber\\\\\n",
    "      & = - k_\\mathrm{B}T\\ln\\left(\\frac{V}{\\Lambda^{3}(N+1)}\\right)+\\mu_\\textrm{ex}\\, , \\nonumber\\tag{3}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where $\\mu_\\textrm{ideal}$ depends only on the density of the system, so it is a constant for systems with different interactions but the same particle density.\n",
    "The interesting part is the excess chemical potential $\\mu_\\textrm{ex}$, which can be expressed in a form involving a canonical average:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "  \\mu-\\mu_\\textrm{ideal}=\\mu_\\textrm{ex}=-k_\\mathrm{B}T\\ln\\left(\\int_{\\left[0,1\\right]^{3}}\\langle\\exp(-\\beta\\Delta U)\\rangle\\,\\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{s}^{N+1}\\right)\\quad .\\tag{4}\n",
    "  \\label{eq:mu_ex}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above expression, $\\Delta U$ is the energy difference of the system before and after the insertion of an additional particle (\"test particle\") into the system, and $\\langle...\\rangle$ is the canonical average for a system with $N$ particles.\n",
    "The expression thus suggests that the excess chemical potential can be computed using the following procedure.\n",
    "The canonical average $\\langle\\exp(-\\beta\\Delta U)\\rangle$ can be computed by inserting a test particle into many different configurations of the system (sampled according to the canonical distribution) and then averaging the associated Boltzmann factor $\\exp(-\\beta\\Delta U)$.\n",
    "Note that this canonical average can be computed using either MC or canonical MD, in the following we will use Langevin MD for this task.\n",
    "The integral over $\\boldsymbol{s}^{N+1}$ corresponds to an average over different insertion positions of the test particle and can be calculated using a brute-force MC approach by simply inserting test particles at many different (random) trial positions for each sampled state of the system."
