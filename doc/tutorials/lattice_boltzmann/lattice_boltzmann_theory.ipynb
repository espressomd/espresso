    "In this tutorial, you will learn the basics of the lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM) with\n",
    "special focus on the application on soft matter simulations or more precisely on how to\n",
    "apply it in combination with molecular dynamics to take into account hydrodynamic\n",
    "solvent effects without the need to introduce thousands of solvent particles. The LBM\n",
    "– its theory as well as its applications – is a very active field of research with\n",
    "more than 30 years of development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tutorial Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial should enable you to start a scientific project applying the LB method\n",
    "with **ESPResSo**. In the first part we summarize a few basic ideas behind LB and\n",
    "describe the interface. In the second part we reproduce the flow profile of a fluid moving through a pipe under a homogeneous force density, which is known as **Poiseuille flow**. In the **Polymer diffusion** tutorial in the `polymers` folder the length dependence of the diffusion of polymers is analyzed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes on the **ESPResSo** version you will need\n",
    "\n",
    "**ESPResSo** offers both CPU and GPU support for LB. We recommend using the GPU code,\n",
    "as it is much (10x) faster than the CPU code. It should be noted, that the GPU code only uses single precision floating point numbers whereas the CPU code uses double precision. For most applications, however, single precision is sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the tutorial you will have to compile in the following features:\n",
    "```c++\n",
    "#define LENNARD_JONES\n",
    "```\n",
    "Please uncomment the features in the <tt>myconfig.hpp</tt> and compile **ESPResSo** using this <tt>myconfig.hpp</tt>. This is not necessary if you do not use a custom <tt>myconfig.hpp</tt>, since the features are activated by default. For more information on configuring **ESPResSo** and how to activate CUDA (for GPU computation), refer to the [documentation](https://espressomd.github.io/doc/installation.html). "
