    "Now the main simulation can begin! The only important thing is to make sure the system has enough time to equilibrate. There are two separate equilibration times: 1) the time for the ion distribution to stabilize, and 2) the time\n",
    "needed for the fluid flow profile to equilibrate. In general, the ion distribution equilibrates fast, so the needed warmup time is largely determined by the fluid relaxation time, which can be calculated via $\\tau_\\mathrm{relax} = \\mathrm{box\\_length}^2/\\nu$. This means for a box of size 40 with a kinematic viscosity of 3 as in our example script, the relaxation time is $\\tau_\\mathrm{relax} = 40^2/3 = 533 \\tau_\\mathrm{MD}$, or 53300 integration steps. In general it is a good idea to run for many relaxation times before starting to use the simulation results for averaging observables. To be on the safe side $10^6$ integration steps is a reasonable equilibration time. Please feel free to modify the provided script and try and get some interesting results!"
