    "## 1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn the basics of the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) with\n",

    "apply it in combination with molecular dynamics to take into account hydrodynamic\n",
    "solvent effects without the need to introduce thousands of solvent particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LBM – its theory as well as its applications – is still a very active field of research.\n",
    "After almost 20 years of development there are many cases in which the LBM has proven\n",
    "to be fruitful, in other cases the LBM is considered promising, and in some cases it has\n",

    "the local thermodynamic equilibrium. This will be described in more detail below.\n",
