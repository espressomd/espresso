    "## 1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn the basics of the lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM) with\n",
    "special focus on the application on soft matter simulations or more precisely on how to\n",
    "apply it in combination with molecular dynamics to take into account hydrodynamic\n",
    "solvent effects without the need to introduce thousands of solvent particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LBM – its theory as well as its applications – is still a very active field of research.\n",
    "After almost 20 years of development there are many cases in which the LBM has proven\n",
    "to be fruitful, in other cases the LBM is considered promising, and in some cases it has\n",

    "the LBM because there is still a lot that is unknown or only vaguely known about this\n",

    "\n",
    "### Tutorial Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial should enable you to start a scientific project applying the LB method\n",
    "with **ESPResSo**. In the first part we summarize a few basic ideas behind LB and\n",
    "describe the interface. In the second part we suggest three different classic examples\n",

    "* **Polymer diffusion.** We analyze the length dependence of the diffusion of polymers.\n",

    "* **Poiseuille flow.** We reproduce the flow profile between two walls.\n",

    "### Notes on the **ESPResSo** version you will need\n",
    "\n",
    "**ESPResSo** offers both CPU and GPU support for LB. We recommend using the GPU code,\n",
    "as it is much (100x) faster than the CPU code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the tutorial you will have to compile in the following features:\n",
