    "### 5.2 Step 2: Diffusion of a polymer\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the typical applications of **ESPResSo** is the simulation of polymer chains with a bead-spring-model. For this we need a repulsive interaction between all beads, for which one usually takes a shifted and truncated Lennard-Jones (so-called Weeks–Chandler–Andersen or WCA) interaction, and additionally a bonded interaction between adjacent beads to hold the polymer together. You have already learned that the command\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "system.non_bonded_inter[0, 0].lennard_jones.set_params(\n",
    "    epsilon=1.0, sigma=1.0,\n",
    "    shift=0.25, cutof=1.226)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "creates a Lennard-Jones interaction with $\\varepsilon=1.$, $\\sigma=1.$,\n",
    "$r_\\text{cut} = 1.125$ and $\\varepsilon_\\text{shift}=0.25$ between particles\n",
    "of type 0, which is the desired \n",
    "repulsive interaction. The command\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from espressomd import interactions\n",
    "fene = interactions.FeneBond(k=7, d_r_max=2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "creates a <tt>FeneBond</tt> object (see **ESPResSo** manual for the details). Still **ESPResSo** does not know between which beads this interaction should be applied. This can be either be specified explicitly or done with the <tt>polymer</tt> module. This creates a given number of beads, links them with the given bonded interaction and places them following a certain algorithm. We will use the pruned self-avoiding walk to place the monomers with a fixed distance between adjacent bead positions. The syntax is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from espressomd import polymer\n",
    "# mpc: monomers per chain\n",
    "mpc = 30\n",
    "poly = polymer.Polymer(N_P=1, MPC=mpc, bond=fene, bond_length=1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to a random walk, the pruned self-avoiding walk limits the risk of the polymer\n",
    "crossing itself (or closely approaching itself). Since the LJ potential is very\n",
    "steep, this would raise the potential energy enormously and would make\n",
    "the monomers shoot through the simulation box. The pruned self-avoiding\n",
    "walk should prevent that, but to be sure we perform some MD steps with a capped LJ potential,\n",
    "i.e. forces above a certain threshold will be set to the threshold to prevent the system from exploding.\n",
    "The script below contains quite a long warmup command to allow longer polymers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows to quickly change the number of monomers without editing the script. For the warmup a Langevin thermostat is used to keep the temperature constant. Furthermore we want to compute the diffusion constant of the polymer for different numbers of monomers. For this purpose we can again use the multiple tau correlator. Have a look at the **ESPResSo**-script for the single particle diffusion and add the adapted commands for the polymer. Find out how many integration steps are necessary to capture the long-time diffusion regime of the polymer. The script already computes the time averaged hydrodynamic radius and stores it in a file <tt>rh_out.dat</tt> whose first column denotes the number of monomers."
