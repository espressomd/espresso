# Polymer theory and Brownian motion of a polymer in a fluid

## Physics learning goals

* Getting a short introduction to the Flory theory of polymers
* Modeling the Brownian motion of a polymer
* Learning about the hydrodynamic radius, radius of gyration, end-to-end distance
* Reproducing theoretical results of the Flory theory of polymers
* Using the Green-Kubo relation to calculate the diffusion coefficient of a polymer
* Estimating the correlation-corrected standard error of the mean of a time series

After the tutorial, students should be able to:

* Explain how hydrodynamic interactions qualitatively affect the diffusion of a polymer
* Name the three important regimes for polymer diffusion and the corresponding scaling laws

## ESPResSo learning goals

* Creating linear polymers with ESPResSo functions
* Using tools from the analysis module not based on the Observable framework
* Setting up correlators for various operations, with compression
