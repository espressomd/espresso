    "\n",
    "In situations where hydrodynamic interactions between swimmers or swimmers and\n",
    "objects are of importance, we use the lattice-Boltzmann (LB) to propagate the\n",
    "fluid's momentum diffusion. We recommend the GPU-based variant of LB in **ESPResSo**,\n",
    "since it is much faster. Moreover, the current implementation of the CPU\n",
    "self-propulsion is limited to one CPU. This is because the ghost-node structure\n",
    "of the **ESPResSo** cell-list code does not allow for straightforward MPI parallellization\n",
    "of the swimmer objects across several CPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of particular importance for self-propulsion at low Reynolds number is the fact\n",
    "that active systems (bacteria, sperm, algae, but also artificial chemically\n",
    "powered swimmers) are force free. That is, the flow field around one of these\n",
    "objects does not contain a monopolar (Stokeslet) contribution. In the case of a\n",
    "sperm cell, see <a href='#fig:pusher-puller'>Fig. 2</a>(a), the reasoning is as follows.\n",
    "The whip-like tail pushes against the fluid and the fluid pushes against the\n",
    "tail, at the same time the head experiences drag, pushing against the fluid and\n",
    "being pushed back against by the fluid. This ensures that both the swimmer and\n",
    "the fluid experience no net force. However, due to the asymmetry of the\n",
    "distribution of forces around the swimmer, the fluid flow still causes net\n",
    "motion. When there is no net force on the fluid, the lowest-order multipole\n",
    "that can be present is a hydrodynamic dipole. Since a dipole has an\n",
    "orientation, there are two types of swimmer: pushers and pullers. The\n",

    "be used to check whether the presence of a dipolar flow field is the dominant\n",
    "term in describing the interactions. The keys `f_swim` and\n",

    "force on the fluid is applied to make the system force free, see\n",
    "<a href='#fig:pusher-puller'>Fig. 2</a>(a) for an illustration of the setup. That is to\n",
