    "Often, in soft-matter physics and chemistry we are interested in systems where the particle numbers are not fixed. This is for instance the case in systems where chemical reactions occur or when particles can be exchanged with a reservoir. The case of changing particle numbers is best described by the grand canonical ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "Canonical Monte-Carlo or molecular dynamics simulations are not suitable for this task, since they conserve the particle numbers. However, the Metropolis Monte Carlo method can be generalized to the Grand-Canonical ensemble in a straightforward manner, yielding the so-called Grand-Canonical Monte Carlo method (GCMC), which is introduced in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial builds on the tutorial [Widom insertion](https://espressomd.github.io/tutorials/widom_insertion/widom_insertion.html), in which you measured the chemical potential of a monovalent salt solution by using a combination of MD and MC techniques. In this part you will make use of the results (i. e. the chemical potentials) of the previous tutorial to simulate the partitioning of salt ions between a reservoir and a polymer solution. Therefore we introduce and use the grand-canonical Monte Carlo method."
