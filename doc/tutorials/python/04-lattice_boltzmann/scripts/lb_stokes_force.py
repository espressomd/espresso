### Measuring the force on a single sphere immersed in a fluid with
### fixed velocity boundary conditions created by two 
### walls at finite distance.
### The force is compared to th analytical result F=6 pi eta r v
### i.e. the stokes force on the particles.


# We create a box of size box_width x box_width x box_length and 
# place an object in the center. We measure the drag force 
# in z direction. We create walls in the xz and yz plane at the box 
# boundaries, where the velocity is fixed to $v.
