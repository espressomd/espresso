    "Welcome to the raspberry electrophoresis **ESPResSo** tutorial! This tutorial assumes some basic knowledge of **ESPResSo**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Electrophoresis denotes the process when charged colloids or macromolecules move through a fluid in an electric field. Charged colloids with a total surface charge $q$ are surrounded by a diffuse layer of ions whith equal but opposite charge $\\approx -q$, as shown in Fig. 1. The colloid's overall charge including the ion shell is therefore close to zero. An external electric field of magnitude $E$ pulls the colloid and its surrounding ion shell in opposite directions, so that the overall force on the colloid is much smaller than one would intuitively expect, i.e. $F \\ll |qE|$. Instead, the electric field causes the colloid and the ion shell to move relative to each other, allowing the colloid to *slip* through the surrounding ion shell. Hydrodynamic friction resists the relative motion of the colloid and the ion shell. Modelling electrophoresis therefore requires not only electrostatic interactions but also hydrodynamic interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is compiling **ESPResSo** with the appropriate flags, as listed in Sec. 2.\n",
    "The tutorial starts by discussing how to build a colloid out of several MD beads. These particles typically\n",
    "resemble a raspberry as can be seen in Fig. 1. After covering the construction of a raspberry colloid, we then\n",
    "briefly discuss the inclusion of hydrodynamic interactions via a lattice-Boltzmann fluid. Finally we will cover\n",
    "including ions via the restrictive primitive model (hard sphere ions) and the addition of an electric field\n",
    "to measure the electrokinetic properties. This script will run a raspberry electrophoresis simulation and write the time and position of the colloid out to a file named <tt>posVsTime.dat</tt> in the same directory.\n",
    "A sample set of data is included in the file <tt>posVsTime_sample.dat</tt>."

In general, the ion distribution equilibrates fast, so the needed warmup time is largely determined by the fluid relaxation time, which can be calculated via $\\tau_\\mathrm{relax} = \\mathrm{box\\_length}^2/\\nu$. This means for a box of size 40 with a kinematic viscosity of 3 as in our example script, the relaxation time is $\\tau_\\mathrm{relax} = 40^2/3 = 533 \\tau_\\mathrm{MD}$, or 53300 integration steps. In general it is a good idea to run for many relaxation times before starting to use the simulation results for averaging observables. To be on the safe side $10^6$ integration steps is a reasonable equilibration time. Please feel free to modify the provided script and try and get some interesting results!"

    "The above code cell saves the trajectory of the raspberry into the file `posVsTime.dat`. For this purpose, the particle's `pos` member should be used, as opposed to its `pos_folded` member, which returns the particle's position folded back into the simulation box. In systems with periodic boundary conditions, particles can \"leave\" the simulation box. When a particle leaves the box, one of its periodic images enters the box from the opposite side, so it might appear that the particle never leaves the box. The truth, however, is that particles *can* leave the simulation box and therefore, their coordinates can end up outside of it. `pos` returns these \"true\" coordinates. On the other hand, `pos_folded` returns the position folded back into the simulation box, which is used to compute interactions between particles, and also for visualization of the simulation box.\n",
