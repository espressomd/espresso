    "\n",
    "Today's research on Soft Condensed Matter has brought the needs for having a flexible, extensible, reliable, and efficient (parallel) molecular simulation package. For this reason ESPResSo (Extensible Simulation Package for Research on Soft Matter Systems) <a href='#[1]'>[1]</a> has been developed at the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research, Mainz, and at the Institute for Computational Physics at the University of Stuttgart in  the group of Prof. Dr. Christian Holm <a href='#[2]'>[2,3]</a>. The ESPResSo package is probably the most flexible and extensible simulation package in the market. It is specifically developed for coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of polyelectrolytes but is not necessarily limited to this. For example, it could also be used to simulate granular media. ESPResSo has been nominated for the Heinz-Billing-Preis for Scientific Computing in 2003 <a href='#[4]'>[4]</a>."

    "## The Lennard-Jones Potential\n",
    "\n",
    "A pair  of  neutral  atoms  or  molecules  is  subject  to  two  distinct  forces  in  the  limit  of large separation and small separation:  an attractive force at long ranges (van der Waals force, or dispersion force) and a repulsive force at short ranges (the result of overlapping electron  orbitals,  referred  to  as  Pauli  repulsion  from  the Pauli  exclusion principle). The Lennard-Jones potential (also  referred  to  as  the  L-J potential, 6-12 potential  or, less commonly, 12-6 potential) is a simple mathematical model that represents this behavior. It  was  proposed  in  1924  by  John  Lennard-Jones. The  L-J  potential  is  of  the  form\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "V(r) = 4\\epsilon \\left[ \\left( \\dfrac{\\sigma}{r} \\right)^{12} - \\left( \\dfrac{\\sigma}{r} \\right)^{6} \\right]\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\epsilon$ is the depth of the potential well and $\\sigma$ is the (finite) distance at which the inter-particle potential is zero and $r$ is the distance between the particles. The $\\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\right)^{12}$ term describes repulsion and the $(\\frac{1}{r})^{6}$  term describes attraction. The Lennard-Jones potential is an\n",
    "approximation. The form of the repulsion term has no theoretical justification; the repulsion force should depend exponentially on the distance, but the repulsion term of the L-J formula is more convenient due to the ease and efficiency of computing $r^{12}$ as the square of $r^6$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the L-J potential is cutoff beyond a specified distance $r_{c}$ and the potential at the cutoff distance is zero.\n",

    "\n",

    "level is interfaced to the kernel via an interpreter of the Python scripting languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kernel performs all computationally demanding tasks. Before all, integration of Newton's equations of motion, including calculation of energies and forces. It also takes care of internal organization of data, storing the data about particles, communication between different processors or cells of the cell-system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scripting interface (Python) is used to setup the system (particles, boundary conditions, interactions etc.), control the simulation, run analysis, and store and load results. The user has at hand the full reliability and functionality of the scripting language. For instance, it is possible to use the SciPy package for analysis and PyPlot for plotting.\n",
    "With a certain overhead in efficiency, it can also be bused to reject/accept new configurations in combined MD/MC schemes. In principle, any parameter which is accessible from the scripting level can be changed at any moment of runtime. In this way methods like thermodynamic integration become readily accessible.\n",

    "1. Modify the code such that half of the particles are of <tt>type=1</tt>. Type 0 is implied for the remaining particles.\n",

Specify Lennard-Jones interactions between type 0 particles with other type 0 particles, type 1 particles with other type 1 particles, and type 0 particles with type 1 particles (set parameters for <tt>system.non_bonded_inter[i,j].lennard_jones</tt> where <tt>{i,j}</tt> can be <tt>{0,0}</tt>, <tt>{1,1}</tt>, and <tt>{0,1}</tt>. Use the same Lennard-Jones parameters for interactions within a component, but use a different <tt>lj_cut_mixed</tt> parameter for the cutoff of the Lennard-Jones interaction between particles of type 0 and particles of type 1. Set this parameter to $2^{\\frac16}\\sigma$ to get de-mixing or to $2.5\\sigma$ to get mixing between the two components.\n",
    "3. Record the radial distribution functions separately for particles of type 0 around particles of type 0, type 1 around particles of type 1, and type 0 around particles of type 1. This can be done by changing the <tt>type_list</tt> arguments of the <tt>system.analysis.rdf()</tt> command. You can record all three radial distribution functions in a single simulation. It is also possible to write them as several columns into a single file.\n",
    "4. Plot the radial distribution functions for all three combinations of particle types. The mixed case will differ significantly, depending on your choice of <tt>lj_cut_mixed</tt>. Explain these differences."
