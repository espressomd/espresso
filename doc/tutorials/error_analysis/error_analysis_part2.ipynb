    "\n",
    "In the first part of the error analysis tutorial we have introduced the binning analysis, an easy and common tool for error estimation. However, we have seen that it failed to deliver an estimate for our second data set. In this tutorial, we will get to know a different method: the *autocorrelation analysis*, sometimes also called *auto-covariance analysis*. It not only delivers an estimate for the standard error of the mean (SEM), but also information on the correlations and the optimal sampling rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start computing anything, we will give a brief overview over the relevant quantities and how they relate to each other. This outlines how one would go about computing these quantities. The end goal of this process is to define an estimator for the standard error of the mean $\\sigma_{\\overline{X}}$. And if the data allows for it, it can be calculated. If it fails, autocorrelation analysis provides more insight into the causes of the failure than the binning analysis from the first part of this tutorial. Albeit being more involved, it can provide a valuable tool for systems with difficult statistics.\n",

    "the expression inside the angled brackets â€” e.g. $\\langle X \\rangle$ is the true mean value of the observable $X$.\n",
    "In the previous part we have established an understanding of correlations as being the \"similarity\" of successive samples.\n",
    "This is an intuitive but inaccurate understanding. The auto-covariance function provides a means to measure and quantify correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computing the auto-covariance for $\\tau=0$ yields the variance $\\sigma=\\langle X^2 \\rangle - \\langle X \\rangle^2$.\n",

These limitations dictate how we can estimate the true (unknown) autocorrelation function. For a finite, time-discrete set of samples $X_i$, a commonly used estimator is the following expression\n",

    "* Actually, the sum does not contain $N$ terms, but $N-|j|$ terms. Consequently, we should divide the whole sum by $N-|j|$ and not by $N$. In fact, this approach yields a different estimator to the auto-covariance function (the so-called *unbiased* estimator). However, for large $N$ and small $j$, both estimators yield similar results. This is why the simpler $N$ is commonly used anyway."

    "We can see that the auto-covariance function starts at a high value and decreases quickly into a long noisy tail which fluctuates around zero. The high values at short lag times indicate that there are strong correlations at short time scales, as expected. However, even though the tail looks uninteresting, it can bear important information about the statistics of your data. Small systematic deviations from 0 in the tail can be a hint that long-term correlations exist in your system. On the other hand, if there is no sign of a systematic deviation from 0 in the tail, this usually means that the correlation is decaying well within the simulation time, and that the statistics are good enough to estimate an error. In the above example, the correlation quickly decays to zero. Despite the noise in the tail, the statistics seem very reasonable."

    "Even though the autocorrelation analysis spits out a number for the SEM, it cannot be trusted. The ACF has a lot of noise in its tail which lets the integrated ACF become very \"random walky\" and therefore unreliable. This means that the ACF has not properly decayed to zero. The only possibility to get better statistics is to simulate for a longer time. Since the autocorrelation time is very long, it is sufficient to store a lot less samples during simulation. The sampling interval could be chosen to be 100 times larger and still capture the statistics sufficiently well."
