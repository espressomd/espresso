    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you are going to learn about Langevin dynamics, as well as two different ways to estimate the diffusion coefficient of the particles in a system.\n",
    "Langevin dynamics is a very easy and therefore widely used technique to add Stokes friction and Brownian motion to a simulation setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a single spherical colloidal particle in a fluid. Due to the absence of further particles and external fields, this particle experiences Brownian motion as a result of the interaction with the solvent molecules. While structural relaxation times for molecular fluids are of the order of $10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{s}$, relevant time scales for Brownian particles are known to be in the order of $10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{s}$. The distinction between slow and fast degrees of freedom allows us to describe the motion of the colloidal particle in terms of the Langevin equation. This equation of motion describes the apparent random movement of the particle in the fluid and is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    m\\dot{{\\bf v}}(t)=-\\gamma {\\bf v}(t)+{\\bf f}(t),\n",
    "    \\tag{1}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $m$ denotes the particle mass and ${\\bf v}(t)$ its velocity. Equation (1) arises from Newton's equation of motion considering that the interaction of the spherical Brownian particle with the solvent has two contributions: 1) a friction force, which is proportional to the velocity of the particle, for not too large velocities, with proportionality constant equal to the friction constant $\\gamma$; and 2) a force ${\\bf f}(t)$ rapidly varying in time due to the the random collisions of the solvent molecules with the surface of the Brownian particle.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a macroscopically large spherical particle, $\\gamma$ is given by the Stokes' law\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\gamma = 6\\pi\\eta_0a,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with $\\eta_0$ the shear viscosity of the fluid and $a$ the radius of the Brownian particle. The ensemble average of the fluctuating force ${\\bf f}(t)$ vanishes, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\langle {\\bf f}(t)\\rangle = 0,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "since the systematic interaction with the fluid is made explicit in the friction term. Owing to the separation in time scales, there is no correlation between impacts in any distinct time intervals. Thus, the second moments of ${\\bf f}$ satisfy\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\langle f_i(t)f_j(t')\\rangle =2\\gamma k_\\text{B}T \\delta_{i,j}\\delta(t-t'),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where one can see that the strength of the fluctuation force depends on the friction coefficient and the system temperature $T$.\n",
    "(The Boltzmann constant is denoted as $k_\\text{B}$ and the two $\\delta$s are Dirac delta functions with respect to particle id and time, respectively.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Langevin equation obviously provides a very straightforward approach to represent both Stokes friction and Brownian motion acting on a particle. However, please be aware that due to its simplicity this technique also has its limitations, i.e., the drag force and diffusion to adjacent particles are uncorrelated and hydrodynamic interactions with the particle's surroundings are neglected. Langevin dynamics should therefore be used with caution, particularly in systems with high particle densities or strong hydrodynamic coupling.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Langevin equation, only ensemble averaged properties of the random ${\\bf f}$ are specified. Consequently, it doesn't  make sense to look at a single deterministic solution of Eq. (1). Instead, one should measure ensemble averaged quantities that characterize the dynamics of the spherical Brownian particle. The simplest quantity is the so-called mean square displacement (MSD) after time $\\tau$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\mathrm{MSD}(\\tau)=\\langle |{\\bf r}(t+\\tau)-{\\bf r}(t)|^2\\rangle.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "From integration of Eq. (1) in three dimensions and considering that ${\\bf v}(t)=\\dot{{\\bf r}}(t)$, one can obtain that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\mathrm{MSD}(\\tau)=6D\\tau\n",
    "$$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    D=\\frac{k_\\text{B}T}{\\gamma}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common approach to measuring the diffusion coefficient is to use linear response theory, which provides links between time correlation functions and the system's response to weak perturbations, the so-called Green-Kubo relations <a href='#[1]'>[1]</a>. For the (translational) diffusion coefficient, the respective Green-Kubo relation is based on integrating the velocity-autocorrelation function (VACF) and reads\n",
