Here $\\Delta E_\\text{pot}$ is the potential energy change due to the reaction, while $\\text{pH - p}K$ is an input parameter composed by two terms, pH and $-\\mathrm{p}K$ (the logarithm of the acid dissociation constant $K$).\n",
    "The prefactor $\\pm 1$ defines the direction of the reaction ($+1$ dissociation, $-1$ association).\n",
    "When a dissociation move is attempted, a titratable molecule $\\mathrm{HA}$ is given a negative charge and a counterion $\\mathrm{H}^+$ is randomly placed into the simulation box, while when an association move is attempted, a $\\mathrm{A}^-$ is neutralized and a random counterion $\\mathrm{H}^+$ is removed from the cell.\n",
    "Be aware that in the constant pH method the system is coupled to an implicit pH bath. That especially means that the number of $\\mathrm{H}^+$ ions in the simulation box does not correspond to the chosen pH. This will lead to wrong screening effects when including electrostatic interactions in the system [1]. How to avoid these artifacts of the constant pH method, however, goes beyond the scope of this simple tutorial. We refer the reader to e.g. [1] for further details."

Moreover, if the reactant list has more species than the products list, reactant molecules in excess are deleted from the system, while if the products list has more species than the reactants list, product molecules in excess are created and randomly placed inside the simulation box. For example, reversing the order of products in our reaction (i.e. from  `product_types=[type_H, type_A]` to `product_types=[type_A, type_H]`), a neutral monomer would be positively charged and a negatively charged monovalent counterion would be randomly placed inside the cell.\n",

    "We also assign charges to each type because in general the charge will play a role in simulations with electrostatic interactions. As an easy task for the interested reader we propose to adapt the tutorial to account for electrostatic interactions. Therefore we keep these values for the needed charge assignments in place, although they are not needed for an ideal system."

    "However, a _statistic_ calculated from a random sample often has a probability distribution different from the\n",
    "sample probability distribution. We will use that to our advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, the values of $\\alpha$ are drawn from a random distribution $X(N_{\\mathrm{A}}, N_{\\mathrm{0}})$ with _parameters_ $N_{\\mathrm{A}}$, $N_{\\mathrm{0}}$ and moments $\\mu_\\alpha = \\operatorname{E}(X)$ and $\\sigma_\\alpha = E([E(X)-X]^2)$.\n",
    "The average $\\bar{\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\alpha_i$ and variance $\\sigma_n^2 = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n (\\alpha_i - \\bar{\\alpha})^2$ of a sample of $n$ independent values $\\alpha_i$ are themselves random variables,\n",

    "from a sample of the population, and can be used as _estimators_ of the moments $\\mu_\\alpha$ and $\\sigma_\\alpha$.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), the random variable $\\sqrt{n}(\\bar{\\alpha} - \\mu_\\alpha)$ has a probability distribution which converges for large sample sizes $n$ to the probability distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_n^2)$. This statement can be rewritten as:\n",
