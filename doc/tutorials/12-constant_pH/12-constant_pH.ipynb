    "\n",
    "This tutorial introduces the basic features for simulating titratable systems via the constant pH method.\n",
    "The constant pH method is one of the methods implemented for simulating systems with chemical reactions within the Reaction Ensemble module. It is a Monte-Carlo method designed to model an acid-base ionization reaction at a given (fixed) value of solution pH.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will consider a homogeneous aqueous solution of a titratable acidic species $\\mathrm{HA}$ that can dissociate in a reaction, that is characterized by the equilibrium constant $\\mathrm{p}K_A=-\\log_{10} K_A$\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{HA} \\Leftrightarrow \\mathrm{A}^- + \\mathrm{H}^+$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If $N_0 = N_{\\mathrm{HA}} + N_{\\mathrm{A}^-}$ is the number of titratable groups in solution, then we define the degree of dissociation $\\alpha$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\alpha = \\dfrac{N_{\\mathrm{A}^-}}{N_0}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is one of the key quantities that can be used to describe the acid-base equilibrium. Usually, the goal of the simulation is to predict the value of $\\alpha$ under given conditions in a complex system with interactions. In this tutorial, we will simulate only ideal systems (without intermolecular interactions) to show that in such case our simulations reproduce the well-known analytical solutions."

    "\n",
    "The equilibrium reaction constant describes the chemical equilibrium of a given reaction. The values of equilibrium constants for various reactions can be found in tables. For the acid-base ionization reaction, the equilibrium constant is conventionally called the acidity constant, and it is defined as\n",

    "K_A = \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{H}^+} a_{\\mathrm{A}^-} } {a_{\\mathrm{HA}}}\n",

    "Note that $K$ is a dimensionless quantity but its numerical value depends on the choice of $c^0$.\n",
    "For an ideal system, $\\gamma_i=1$ by definition, whereas for an interacting system $\\gamma_i$ is a non-trivial function of the interactions. For an ideal system we can rewrite $K$ in terms of equilibrium concentrations\n",

    "### 1.2 Constant pH Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The constant pH method [Reed1992] is designed to simulate an acid-base ionization reaction at a given pH. It assumes that the simulated system is coupled to an implicit reservoir of $\\mathrm{H^+}$ ions but exchange of ions with this reservoir is not explicitly simulated. Therefore, the number of $\\mathrm{H}^+$ ions in the simulation box does not correspond to the chosen pH. This may lead to artifacts when simulating interacting systems, especially at high of low pH values. Discussion of these artifacts is beyond the scope of this tutorial (see e.g. [Landsgesell2019] for further details).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Espresso, the forward step of the ionization reaction (from left to right) is implemented by \n",
    "changing the chemical identity (particle type) of a randomly selected $\\mathrm{HA}$ particle to $\\mathrm{A}^-$, and inserting another particle that represents $\\mathrm{H}^+$. In the reverse direction (from right to left), the chemical identity (particle type) of a randomly selected $\\mathrm{A}^{-}$ is changed to $\\mathrm{HA}$, and a randomly selected $\\mathrm{H}^+$ is deleted from the simulation box. The probability of proposing the  forward reaction step is $P_\\text{prop}=N_\\mathrm{HA}/N_0$, and probability of proposing the reverse step is $P_\\text{prop}=N_\\mathrm{A}/N_0$. The trial move is accepted with the acceptance probability\n",

When a reaction move is performed, identity of the first species in the list of reactants is changed to the first species in the list of products, the second reactant species is changed to the second product species, and so on. If the reactant list has more species than the product list, then excess reactant species are deleted from the system. If the product list has more species than the reactant list, then product the excess product species are created and randomly placed inside the simulation box. This is especially relevant if some of the species belong to a chain-like molecule.\n",

Reversing the order of products in our reaction (i.e. from  `product_types=[TYPE_H, TYPE_A]` to `product_types=[TYPE_A, TYPE_H]`), would result in a reaction move, where the identity HA would be changed to $\\mathrm{H^{+}}$, while $\\mathrm{A^{-}}$ would be inserted/deleted at a random position in the box.\n",
    "We also assign charges to each type because in general the charge will play a role in simulations with electrostatic interactions. As an easy task for the interested reader we propose to adapt the tutorial to account for electrostatic interactions. Therefore we keep these values for the needed charge assignments in place, although they are not needed for an ideal system."

    "### 3.1 Statistical Uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "The molecular simulation produces a sequence of snapshots of the system, that \n",
    "constitute a Markov chain. It is a sequence of realizations of a random process, where\n",
    "the next value in the sequence depends on the preceding one. Therefore,\n",
    "the subsequent values are correlated. To estimate statistical error of the averages\n",
    "determined in the simulation, one needs to correct for the correlations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will use a rudimentary way of correcting for correlations, termed the binning method.\n",
    "We refer the reader to specialized literature for a more sophisticated discussion [Janke2002]. The general idea is to group a long sequence of correlated values into a rather small number of blocks, and compute an average per each block. If the blocks are big enough, they\n",
    "can be considered uncorrelated, and one can apply the formula for standard error of the mean of uncorrelated values. If the number of blocks is small, then they are uncorrelated but the obtained error estimates has a high uncertainty. If the number of blocks is high, then they are too short to be uncorrelated, and the obtained error estimates are systematically lower than the correct value. Therefore, the method works well only if the sample size is much greater than the autocorrelation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, we use a fixed number of 8 blocks to obtain the error estimates. To check for consistency, we estimate the autocorrelation time, and print a warning message if some blocks contain less than 100 uncorrelated values. Intentionally, we make our simulation slightly too short, so that it does not produce enough uncorrelated samples. We encourage the reader to vary the number of blocks or the number of samples to see how the estimated error changes with these parameters."

For 68% of the results, the deviation from the analytical result should be within the error bar, whereas 95% of the results should be within two times the error bar. Indeed, if you plot the deviations by running the script below, you should observe that most of the results are within one error bar from the analytical solution, a smaller fraction  of the results is slightly further than one error bar, and one or two might be about two error bars apart.\n",
