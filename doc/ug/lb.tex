\chapter{Lattice-Boltzmann}
\label{sec:lb}
\newescommand{lb}

For an implicit treatment of a solvent, \es allows to couple the
molecular dynamics simulation to a Lattice-Boltzmann fluid. The Lattice-
Boltzmann-Method (LBM) is a fast, lattice based method that allows in its
``pure'' form to calculate fluid flow in different boundary conditions
also in complex geometries. Coupled to molecular dynamics, it allows
to take hydrodynamic interactions into account
computationally efficiently. The implementation of boundary conditions
for the LBM is a difficult task, where still a lot of research is going 
on. The focus of the \es implementation of the LBM is, of course, the
coupling to MD and therefore available geometries and boundary
conditions are somewhat limited compared to ``pure'' codes. 


Here we restrict the documentation on the interface. For a more detailed
description of the method, please refer to the literature.

\section{Setting up and LB fluid}
\begin{essyntax}
  lbfluid
  \opt{agrid  \var{agrid}}
  \opt{dens  \var{density}}
  \opt{visc  \var{viscosity}}
  \opt{tau  \var{lb\_timestep}}
  \opt{bulk_visc  \var{bulk\_viscosity}}
  \opt{ext_force  \var{f_x} \var{f_y} \var{f_z}}
  \opt{friction   \var{gamma} } 
  \opt{gamma_odd  \var{gamma\_odd}}
  \opt{gamma_even  \var{gamma\_even}}
  \begin{features}
  \required{LB}
  \end{features}
\end{essyntax}
The \lit{lbfluid} command initializes the fluid with a given
set of parameters. It is also possible to change parameters on the
fly, but this will only rarely be done in practice. Before being able
to use the LBM, it is necessary to set up a box of a desired size. The
parameter \lit{agrid} is used to set the lattice constant of the
fluid, so the size of the box in every direction must be a multiple of
\var{agrid}.

In \es the LB scheme and the MD scheme are not synchronized: In one LB
time step typically several MD steps are performed. This allows to
speed up the simulations and is adjusted with the parameter \var{tau},
the LB timestep.
The parameters \var{dens} and \var{visc} set up the density and
viscosity of the LB fluid in (usual) MD units.  Internally the LB
implementation works with a different set of units: all lengths are
expressed in \var{agrid}, all times in \var{tau} and so on.  Therefore
changing \var{agrid} and \var{tau}, might change the behaviour of the
LB fluid, \eg at boundaries, due to characteristics of the LBM
itself. Currently it is not possible to precisely give a parameter set
where reliable results are expected, but we are currently performing a
study on that. Therefore the LBM should \emph{not be used as a black
  box}, but only after a careful check of all parameters that were
applied. 

The parameter \lit{ext_force} allows to apply an external body force
density that is homogeneous over the fluid. It is again to be given in
MD units.  The parameter \lit{bulk_viscosity} allows to tune the bulk
viscosity of the fluid and is given in MD units. In the limit of low
Mach (often also low Reynolds) number the results should be
independent of the bulk viscosity up to a scaling factor. 
It is however known that the values of the viscosity does 
affect the quality of the implemented link-bounce-back method.
\lit{gamma_odd} and
\lit{gamma_even} are the relaxation parameters for the kinetic
modes. Due to their somewhat obscure nature they are to be given
directly in LB units.

Before running a simulation at least the following parameters must be
set up: \lit{agrid}, \lit {dens}, \lit{visc}, \lit{tau},
\lit{friction}. For the other parameters, the following are taken:
\var{bulk\_viscosity}=0, , \var{gamma\_odd}=0, \var{gamma\_even}=0,
\var{ f_x} = \var{ f_y} = \var{ f_z} = 0.

\section{LB as a thermostat}
\begin{essyntax}
  thermostat lb \var{T} 
  \begin{features}
  \required{LB}
  \end{features}
\end{essyntax}
The LBM implementation in \es uses Duenweg's point coupling method
to couple MD particles the LB fluid. This coupling consists
in a frictional force and a random force:
\begin{equation*}
  \vec{F} = -\gamma \left(\vec{v}-\vec{u}\right) + \vec{F}_R.
\end{equation*}
The frictional force tends to decrease the relative velocity
between the fluid and the particle whereas the random forces are chosen
so large that the average kinetic energy per particle corresponds to
the given temperature, according to a fluctuation dissipation theorem.
No other thermostatting mechanism is necessary then. Please any of these
off before starting the LB thermostatting mechanism.

The LBM implementation provides a fully thermalized LB fluid, \ie all
nonconserved modes, including the pressure tensor, fluctuate correctly
according to the given temperature and the relaxation parameters. All
fluctuations can be switched off by setting the temperature to 0.


\section{Reading and setting single lattice nodes}
\begin{essyntax}
  lbnode \var{x} \var{y} \var{z} \alt{print \asep set} \var{args}
  \begin{features}
  \required{LB}
  \end{features}
\end{essyntax}
The \lit{lbnode} command allows to inspect (\lit{print}) and modify
(\lit{set}) single LB nodes.  Note that the indexing in every
direction starts with 0.  For both commands you have to specify what
quantity should be printed
or modified. Print allows the following arguments: \\
\begin{tabular}{p{0.2\columnwidth}p{0.5\columnwidth}}
  \lit{rho}\ & the density (scalar). \\
  \lit{u} & the fluid velocity (three floats: $u_x$, $u_y$, $u_z$) \\
  \lit{pi} & the fluid velocity (six floats: $\Pi_{xx}$, $\Pi_{xy}$, $\Pi_{yy}$, $\Pi_{xz}$,  $\Pi_{yz}$,  $\Pi_{zz}$) \\
  \lit{pi_neq} & the nonequilbrium part of the pressure tensor, components as above. \\
  \lit{pop} & the 19 population (check the order from the source code please).
\end{tabular} \\
Example:
The line
\begin{tclcode}
puts [ lbnode 0 0 0 print u ]
\end{tclcode}
prints the fluid velocity in node 0 0 0 to the screen.  The command
\lit{set} allows to change the density or fluid velocity in a single
node. Setting the other quantities can easily be implemented.
Example:
\begin{tclcode}
puts [ lbnode 0 0 0 set u 0.01 0. 0.]
\end{tclcode}

\section{Setting up boundary conditions}
\begin{essyntax}
  lbboundary \var{shape} \var{shape\_args} 
  \begin{features}
  \required{LB_BOUNDARIES}
  \end{features}
\end{essyntax}
If nothing else is specified periodic boundary conditions are assumed 
for the LB fluid. The \lit{lbboundary} command allows to set up
other (internal or external) boundaries.

The \lit{lbboundary} command syntax is very close to the
\lit{constraint} syntax, as usually one wants the hydrodynamic
boundary conditions to be shaped similar to the MD
boundaries. Currently the above mentioned shapes are available and
their syntax follows exactly the syntax of the constraint command. For
example
\begin{tclcode}
  lbboundary wall dist 1.5 normal 1. 0. 0. 
\end{tclcode}
creates a planar boundary condition at distance 1.5 from the origin of
the coordinate system where the half space $x>1.5$ is treated as
normal LB fluid, and the other half space is filled with boundary
nodes.

Intersecting boundaries are in principle possible but must be treated
with care. In the current, only partly satisfactory, implementation for
every LB node the closest boundary is determined and in case of a
negative distance to that boundary (meaning being inside the wall)
lets \es decide that it is a wall node, and a positive one, that it is
not.  This allows example multiple parallel channels, but is is not
always clear that a rectangularly shaped channel can be
constructed. Suggestions on how to solve this issue are very welcome.

Currently, only the so called ``link-bounce-back'' algorithm for wall
nodes is available. This creates a boundary that is located
approximately midway between the lattice nodes, so in the above
example this corresponds indeed to a boundary at $x=1.5$. Note that
the location of the boundary is unfortunately not independent of the
viscosity. This can \eg be seen when using the sample script
\lit{poisseuille.tcl} with a high viscosity.

\section{Choosing between the GPU and CPU implementations}
\begin{essyntax}
  \variant{1} lbfluid cpu
  \variant{2} lbfluid gpu
  \begin{features}
    \required[1]{LB}
    \required[2]{LB_GPU}
  \end{features}
\end{essyntax}

A very recent development is an implementation of the LBM for NVIDIA
GPUs using the CUDA framework.  On CUDA-supporting machines this can
be activated by configuring with \lit{configure
  --with-cuda=/path/to/cuda} and activating the feature \lit{LB_GPU}.
Within the \es-Tcl-script, the \lit{lbfluid} command can be used to
choose between the CPU and GPU implementations of the
Lattice-Boltzmann algorithm, for further information on CUDA support
see section~\ref{sec:cuda}.

Variant \variant{1} is the default and turns on the standard CPU
implementation of the Lattice-Boltzmann fluid, while variant
\variant{2} turns on the GPU implementation, implying that all
following LB-related commands are executed on the GPU.

Currently only a subset of the CPU commands are available for the GPU
implementation.  For boundary conditions analogous to the CPU
implementation, the feature \lit{LB_BOUNDARIES_GPU} has to be
activated.
