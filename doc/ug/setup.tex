\section{\texttt{thermostat}: Setting up the thermostat}
\label{sec:thermostat}
\newescommand{thermostat}

The \keyword{thermostat} command is used to change settings of the
thermostat.  

The different available thermostats will be described in the following
subsections. Note that for a simulation of the NPT ensemble, you need
to use a standard thermostat for the particle velocities (\eg Langevin
or DPD), and a thermostat for the box geometry (\eg the isotropic NPT
thermostat).

You may combine different thermostats at your own risk by turning them
on one by one. Note that there is only one temperature for all
thermostats.

\begin{essyntax}
  \variant{1} thermostat
  \variant{2} thermostat off
  \variant{3} thermostat \var{parameters}
\end{essyntax}

Variant \variant{1} returns the thermostat parameters. A Tcl list is
given containing all the parameters needed to set the specific
thermostat. (exactly the same as the input command line, without the
preceding \texttt{thermostat}).

Variant \variant{2} turns off all thermostats and sets all thermostat 
variables to zero. Setting temperature to zero also affects the way in which 
electrostatics are handled (see also Section~\ref{sec:inter-electrostatics}).

Variant \variant{3} sets up one of the thermostats described below.

\subsection{Langevin thermostat}
\begin{essyntax}
  thermostat langevin \var{temperature} \var{gamma}
\end{essyntax}

The Langevin thermostat consists of a friction and noise term coupled
via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. The friction term is a
function of the particle velocities. For a more detailed explanation,
refer to \cite{berendsen84a, grest86a}.

If the feature \feature{ROTATION} is compiled in, the rotational
degrees of freedom are also coupled to the thermostat.

Using the Langevin thermostat, it is posible to set a temperature and
a friction coefficient for every particle individually. Consult the
\texttt{part} commands reference (chapter \ref{chap:part}) for
information on how to achieve this.

\subsection{GHMC thermostat}

\begin{essyntax}
  thermostat ghmc \var{temperature} \var{n\_md} \var{phi} \opt{-no_flip | -flip
| -random_flip} \opt{-no_scale | -scale}
\end{essyntax}

\es implements Generalized Hybrid Monte Carlo (GHMC) as a thermostat. GHMC is a
simulation method for sampling the canonical ensemble \cite{mehlig92}. The
method consists of MC cycles that combine a few constant energy MD steps,
specified by \var{n\_md}, followed by a Metropolis criterion for their
acceptance. Prior to integration, the particles momenta are mixed with momenta
sampled from the appropriate Boltzmann distribution. 

Given the particles momenta $\mathbf{p}^j$ from the last $j^{th}$
GHMC cycle the new momenta are generated
by: $\mathbf{p}^{j+1}=\cos(\phi)\mathbf{p}^j+\sin(\phi)\pmb{\xi}$, where
$\pmb{\xi}$ is a noise vector of random Gaussian variables with zero mean
and variance $1/\var{temperature}$ (see 
\cite{horowitz91} for more details). The
momenta mixing parameter $\cos(\phi)$ corresponds to \var{phi} in the
implementation.

In case the MD step is rejected, the particles momenta may be
flipped. This is specified by setting the \keyword{-no_flip} /
\keyword{-flip} option, for the \keyword{-random_flip} option half of the
rejected MD steps randomly result in momenta flip. The default for momenta
flip is \keyword{-no_flip}. The $\pmb{\xi}$ noise vector's variance van be
tuned to exactly $1/\var{temperature}$ by specifying the \keyword{-scale}
option. The default for temperature scaling is \keyword{-no_scale}.


\subsection{Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) } \label{sec:DPD}
\index{DPD|mainindex}

\es implements Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) either via a global
thermostat, or via a thermostat and a special DPD interaction between
particle types.  The latter allows the user to specify friction
coefficients on a per-interaction basis.

\subsubsection{Thermostat DPD}
\index{label:DPDthermostat}

\begin{essyntax}
  thermostat dpd \var{temperature} \var{gamma} \var{r\_cut} \opt{ WF
    \var{wf}  \var{tgamma} \var{tr\_cut} TWF \var{twf}}
  \begin{features}
    \required{DPD} or \required{TRANS_DPD}
  \end{features}
\end{essyntax}

\es's standard DPD thermostat implements the thermostat exactly as
described in \cite{soddeman03a}.  We use the standard
\textit{Velocity-Verlet} integration scheme, \eg DPD only influences
the calculation of the forces. No special measures have been taken to
self-consistently determine the velocities and the dissipative forces
as it is for example described in \cite{Nikunen03}.  DPD adds a
velocity dependent dissipative force and a random force to the usual
conservative pair forces (e.g. Lennard-Jones).

The dissipative force is calculated by

$$ \vec{F}_{ij}^{D} = -\zeta w^D (r_{ij}) (\hat{r}_{ij} \cdot \vec{v}_{ij}) \hat{r}_{ij} $$

The random force by

$$ \vec{F}_{ij}^R = \sigma w^R (r_{ij}) \Theta_{ij} \hat{r}_{ij} $$

where $ \Theta_{ij} \in [ -0.5 , 0.5 [ $ is a uniformly distributed random number.
The connection of $\sigma $ and $\zeta $ is given by the dissipation fluctuation theorem:
 
$$ (\sigma w^R (r_{ij})^2=\zeta w^D (r_{ij}) \text{k}_\text{B} T $$

The parameters \var{gamma} \var{r\_cut} define the strength of the
friction $\zeta$ and the cutoff radius.

According to the optional parameter WF (can be set to 0 or 1, default
is 0) of the thermostat command the functions $w^D$ and $w^R$ are
chosen in the following way ( $ r_{ij} < \var{r\_cut} $ ) :

$$ 
w^D (r_{ij}) = ( w^R (r_{ij})) ^2 = 
   \left\{
   \begin{array}{clcr} 
             {( 1 - \frac{r_{ij}}{r_c}} )^2 & , \; WF = 0 \\
             1                      & , \; WF = 1
   \end{array}
   \right.
$$

For $ r_{ij} \ge \var{r\_cut} $  $w^D$ and $w^R$ are identical to 0 in both cases.

The friction (dissipative) and noise (random) term are coupled via the
fluctuation- dissipation theorem. The friction term is a function of
the relative velocity of particle pairs.  The DPD thermostat is better
for dynamics than the Langevin thermostat, since it mimics
hydrodynamics in the system.

When using a Lennard-Jones interaction, $\var{r\_cut} =
2^{\frac{1}{6}} \sigma$ is a good value to choose, so that the
thermostat acts on the relative velocities between nearest neighbor
particles.  Larger cutoffs including next nearest neighbors or even
more are unphysical.

\var{gamma} is basically an inverse timescale on which the system
thermally equilibrates.  Values between $0.1$ and $1$ are o.k, but you
propably want to try this out yourself to get a feeling for how fast
temperature jumps during a simulation are. The dpd thermostat does not
act on the system center of mass motion.  Therefore, before using dpd,
you have to stop the center of mass motion of your system, which you
can achieve by using the command \keyword{galileiTransformParticles} 
\ref{sec:centerofmassmotion}. This may be repeated once in a while for long 
runs due to round off errors (check this with the command 
\keyword{system_com_vel}) \ref{sec:centerofmassmotion}.

Two restrictions apply for the dpd implementation of \es:

\begin{itemize}
\item As soon as at least one of the two interacting particles is
  fixed (see~\ref{chap:part} on how to fix a particle in space) the
  dissipative and the stochastic force part is set to zero for both
  particles (you should only change this hardcoded behaviour if you
  are sure not to violate the dissipation fluctuation theorem).
\item \texttt{DPD} does not take into account any internal rotational
  degrees of freedom of the particles if \texttt{ROTATION} is switched
  on. Up to the current version DPD only acts on the translatorial
  degrees of freedom.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Transverse DPD thermostat}\label{sec:transDPD}
This is an extension of the above standard DPD thermostat
\cite{junghans2008}, which dampens the degrees of freedom
perpendicular on the axis between two particles. To switch it on, the
feature \feature{TRANS_DPD} is required instead of the feature
\texttt{DPD}.

The dissipative force is calculated by

$$ \vec{F}_{ij}^{D} = -\zeta w^D (r_{ij}) (I-\hat{r}_{ij}\otimes\hat{r}_{ij}) \cdot \vec{v}_{ij}$$

The random force by

$$ \vec{F}_{ij}^R = \sigma w^R (r_{ij}) (I-\hat{r}_{ij}\otimes\hat{r}_{ij}) \cdot \vec{\Theta}_{ij}$$

The parameters \var{tgamma} \var{tr\_cut} define the strength of the
friction and the cutoff in the same way as above.  Note: This
thermostat does \emph{not} conserve angular momentum.

\subsubsection{Interaction DPD}\label{sec:interDPD}
\index{Interaction DPD}

\begin{essyntax}
  thermostat inter_dpd \var{temperature}
  \begin{features}
    \required{INTER_DPD}
  \end{features}
\end{essyntax}

Another way to use DPD is by using the interaction DPD. In this case,
DPD is implemented via a thermostat and corresponding interactions.
The above command will set the global temperature of the system, while
the friction and other parameters have to be set via the command
\texttt{inter inter_dpd} (see \vref{sec:DPDinter}).  This allows to
set the friction on a per-interaction basis.

\subsubsection{Other DPD extensions}
The features \feature{DPD_MASS_RED} or \feature{DPD_MASS_LIN} make the
friction constant mass dependent:
$$ \zeta \to \zeta M_{ij} $$ 
and 
$$ \zeta \to \zeta M_{ij} $$
There are two implemented cases. \feature{DPD_MASS_RED} uses the
reduced mass:
$$ M_{ij}=2\frac{m_i m_j}{m_i+m_j} $$
while \feature{DPD_MASS_LIN} uses the real mass mass:
$$ M_{ij}=\frac{m_i+m_j}{2} $$
The prefactors are such that equal masses result in a factor 1.

\subsection{Isotropic NPT thermostat}
\label{ssec:NPTthermostat}
\begin{essyntax}
  thermostat npt_isotropic \var{temperature} \var{gamma0} \var{gammaV}
  \begin{features}
    \required{NPT}
  \end{features}
\end{essyntax}

This theormstat is based on the Anderson thermostat (see
\cite{andersen80a, mann05d}) and will thermalize the box geometry. It
will only do isotropic changes of the box.

Be aware that this feature is neither properly examined for all
systems nor is it maintained regularly. If you use it and notice
strange behaviour, please contribute to solving the problem.

\section{\texttt{nemd}: Setting up non-equilibrium MD}
\newescommand{nemd}
\label{sec:NEMD}
\index{NEMD}

\begin{essyntax}
  \variant{1}nemd exchange \var{n\_slabs} \var{n\_exchange}
  \variant{2}nemd shearrate \var{n\_slabs} \var{shearrate}
  \variant{3}nemd off
  \variant{4}nemd
  \variant{5}nemd profile
  \variant{6}nemd viscosity
  \begin{features}
    \required{NEMD}
  \end{features}
\end{essyntax}

Use NEMD (Non Equilibrium Molecular Dynamics) to simulate a system
under shear with help of an unphysical momentum change in two slabs in
the system.

Variants \variant{1} and \variant{2} will initialise NEMD. Two
distinct methods exist.  Both methods divide the simulation box into
\var{n\_slab} slabs that lie parallel to the x-y-plane and apply a
shear in x direction.  The shear is applied in the top and the middle
slabs. Note, that the methods should be used with a DPD thermostat or
in an NVE ensemble.  Furthermore, you should not use other special
features like \keyword{part fix} or \keyword{constraints} inside the
top and middle slabs. For further reference on how NEMD is implemented
into \es see \cite{soddeman01a}.


\index{momentum exchange method}
Variant \variant{1} chooses the momentum exchange method.  In this
method, in each step the \var{n\_exchange} largest positive
x-components of the velocity in the middle slab are selected and
exchanged with the \var{n\_exchange} largest negative x-components of
the velocity in the top slab. 

\index{shear-rate method}
Variant \variant{2} chooses the shear-rate method. In this method, the
targetted x-component of the mean velocity in the top and middle slabs
are given by 
\begin{equation}
  \var{target\_velocity} = \pm \var{shearrate}\,\frac{L_z}{4}
\end{equation}
where $L_z$ is the simulation box size in z-direction. During the
integration, the x-component of the mean velocities of the top and
middle slabs are measured.  Then, the difference between the mean
x-velocities and the target x-velocities are added to the x-component
of the velocities of the particles in the respective slabs. 

Variant \variant{3} will turn off NEMD, variant \variant{4} will
print usage information of the parameters of NEMD. Variant \variant{5} will return the
velocity profile of the system in x-direction (mean velocity per slab).

Variant \variant{6} will return the viscosity of the system, that is
computed via
\begin{equation}
  \eta = \frac{F}{\dot{\gamma} L_x L_y}
\end{equation}
where $F$ is the mean force (momentum transfer per unit time) acting
on the slab, $L_x L_y$ is the area of the slab and $\dot{\gamma}$ is the shearrate. 


\section{\texttt{cellsystem}: Setting up the cell system}
\label{sec:cell-systems}
\newescommand{cellsystem}

This section deals with the flexible particle data organization of
\es.  Due to different needs of different algorithms, \es is able to
change the organization of the particles in the computer memory,
according to the needs of the used algorithms. For details on the
internal organization, refer to section
\vref{sec:internal-particle-organization}.

\subsection{Domain decomposition}
\index{domain decomposition}
\begin{essyntax}
  cellsystem domain_decomposition \opt{-no_verlet_list}
\end{essyntax}
This selects the domain decomposition cell scheme, using Verlet lists
for the calculation of the interactions. If you specify
\keyword{-no_verlet_list}, only the domain decomposition is used, but
not the Verlet lists.

The domain decomposition cellsystem is the default system and suits
most applications with short ranged interactions. The particles are
divided up spatially into small compartments, the cells, such that the
cell size is larger than the maximal interaction range. In this case
interactions only occur between particles in adjacent cells. Since the
interaction range should be much smaller than the total system size,
leaving out all interactions between non-adjacent cells can mean a
tremendous speed-up. Moreover, since for constant interaction range,
the number of particles in a cell depends only on the density. The
number of interactions is therefore of the order N instead of order
$N^2$ if one has to calculate all pair interactions.

\subsection{N-squared}
\begin{essyntax}
  cellsystem nsquare 
\end{essyntax}
This selects the very primitive nsquared cellsystem, which calculates
the interactions for all particle pairs. Therefore it loops over all
particles, giving an unfavorable computation time scaling of $N^2$.
However, algorithms like MMM1D or the plain Coulomb interaction in the
cell model require the calculation of all pair interactions.

In a multiple processor environment, the nsquared cellsystem uses a
simple particle balancing scheme to have a nearly equal number of
particles per CPU, \ie $n$ nodes have $m$ particles, and $p-n$ nodes
have $m+1$ particles, such that $n*m+(p-n)*(m+1)=N$, the total number
of particles. Therefore the computational load should be balanced
fairly equal among the nodes, with one exception: This code always
uses one CPU for the interaction between two different nodes. For an
odd number of nodes, this is fine, because the total number of
interactions to calculate is a multiple of the number of nodes, but
for an even number of nodes, for each of the $p-1$ communication
rounds, one processor is idle.

E.g. for 2 processors, there are 3 interactions: 0-0, 1-1, 0-1.
Naturally, 0-0 and 1-1 are treated by processor 0 and 1, respectively.
But the 0-1 interaction is treated by node 1 alone, so the workload
for this node is twice as high. For 3 processors, the interactions are
0-0, 1-1, 2-2, 0-1, 1-2, 0-2. Of these interactions, node 0 treats 0-0
and 0-2, node 1 treats 1-1 and 0-1, and node 2 treats 2-2 and 1-2.

Therefore it is highly recommended that you use nsquared only with an
odd number of nodes, if with multiple processors at all. 

\subsection{Layered cell system}
\begin{essyntax}
  cellsystem layered \var{n\_layers}
\end{essyntax}

This selects the layered cell system, which is specifically designed
for the needs of the MMM2D algorithm. Basically it consists of a
nsquared algorithm in x and y, but a domain decomposition along z, i.
e. the system is cut into equally sized layers along the z axis. The
current implementation allows for the cpus to align only along the z
axis, therefore the processor grid has to have the form 1x1xN.
However, each processor may be responsible for several layers, which
is determined by \var{n\_layers}, i. e. the system is split into
N*\var{n\_layers} layers along the z axis. Since in x and y direction
there are no processor boundaries, the implementation is basically
just a stripped down version of the domain decomposition cellsystem.

\section{CUDA}
\label{sec:cuda}
\begin{essyntax}
  \variant{1} cuda list
  \variant{2} cuda setdevice \var{id}
  \variant{3} cuda getdevice
\end{essyntax}

This command can be used to choose the GPU for all subsequent
GPU-computations. Note that due to driver limitations, the GPU cannot
be changed anymore after the first GPU-using command has been issued,
for example \texttt{lbfluid}. If you do not choose the GPU manually
before that, CUDA internally chooses one, which is normally the most
powerful GPU available, but load-independent.

Variant \variant{1} lists the available devices by their ids and brand
names. Variant \variant{2} allows to choose the device by its id,
which can be determined using \texttt{cuda list}, or for example the
\texttt{deviceQuery} example code in the CUDA SDK. Variant \variant{3}
finally gives the id of the currently active GPU.


\section{Creating bonds when particles collide}

\begin{citebox}
  Please cite~\citewbibkey{espresso2} when using dynamic bonding.
\end{citebox}


\begin{essyntax}
\variant{1} collision_detection
\variant{2} collision_detection off
\variant{4} collision_detection \opt{exception} bind_centers \var{d} \var{bond1}
\variant{5} collision_detection \opt{exception} bind_at_point_of_collision \var{d} \var{bond1} \var{bond2} \var{type}
\end{essyntax}

With the help of the feature \feature{COLLISION_DETECTION}, bonds
between particles can be created automatically during the simulation,
every time two particles collide. This is useful for simulations of
chemical reactions and irreversible adhesion processes.

Two methods of binding are available:
\begin{itemize}
\item \lit{bind_centers} adds a bonded interaction between the
  colliding particles at the first collision. This leads to the
  distance between the particles being fixed, the particles can,
  however still slide around each other.

  The parameters are as follows: \var{d} is the distance at which the
  bond is created. \var{bond1} denotes a pair bond and is the type of
  the bond created between the colliding particles. Particles that are
  already bound by a bond of this type do not get a new bond, in order
  to avoid creating multiple bonds.

\item \lit{bind_at_point_of_collision} prevents sliding of the
  particles at the contact. This is achieved by creating two virtual
  sites at the point of collision. They are rigidly connectd to the
  colliding particles, respectively. A bond is then created between
  the virtual sites, or an angular bond between the two real particles
  and the virtual particles. In the latter case, the virtual particles
  are the centers of the angle potentials (particle 2 in the
  description of the angle potential, see \ref{sec:angle}). Due to the
  rigid connection between each of the particles in the collision and
  its respective virtual site, a sliding at the contact point is no
  longer possible.  See the documentation on rigid bodies for
  details. In addition to the bond between the virtual sites, the bond
  between the colliding particles is also created. You can either use
  a real bonded interaction to prevent wobbling around the point of
  contact or you can use a virtual bond to prevent additional force
  contributions, at the expense of RATTLE, see \ref{sec:rattle}.

  The parameters \var{d} and \var{bond1} are the same as for the
  \lit{bind_centers} method. \var{bond2} determines the type of the
  bond created between the virtual sites (if applicable), and can be
  either a pair or a triple (angle) bond. If it is a pair bond, it
  connects the two virtual particles, otherwise it constraints the
  angle between the two real particles around the virtual
  ones. \var{type} denotes the particle type of the virtual sites
  created at the point of collision (if applicable). Be sure not to
  define a short-ranged interaction for this particle type, as two
  particles will be generated in the same place.
\end{itemize}

The code can throw an exception (background error) in case two
particles collide for the first time, if the \lit{exception} keyword
is added to the invocation. In conjunction with the \lit{catch}
command of Tcl, this can be used to intercept the collision:
\begin{tclcode}
if {[catch {integrate 0} err]} {
  foreach exception [lrange $err 2 end] {
    if {[lrange $exception 0 2] == "collision between particles"} {
      set i [lindex $exception 3]
      set j [lindex $exception 5]
      puts "particles $i and $j collided"
    }
  }
}
\end{tclcode}

The following limitations currently apply for the collision detection:
\begin{itemize}
\item The method is currently limited to simulations with a single cpu
\item No distinction is currently made between different particle types
\item The ``bind at point of collision'' approach requires the
  \feature{VIRTUAL_SITES_RELATIVE} feature
\item The ``bind at point of collision'' approach cannot handle
  collisions between virtual sites
\end{itemize}

\section{Reactions}
\label{sec:Reactions}

With the help of the feature \feature{REACTIONS}, one can define three particle
types to act as reactant, catalyzer and product. Reactant particles that are 
closer to at least one catalyzer particle than a user defined range are 
stochastically converted into particles of the product type. The rate at which 
this reaction happens can be defined by the user as well. Since an Espresso 
simulation only contains a finite number of particles, product particles also
must react back into reactant particles in order allow for an equilibrium other 
than only product particles.
This back reaction takes place at any point of the simulation volume and unless 
the user defines a custom rate for the back reaction, the rate is dynamically 
chosen to be
\begin{equation}
k_\text{back} = k_\text{back} \cdot \frac{n_\text{product}}{n_\text{reactant}},
\end{equation}
which results in an equilibrium of half product and half reactant, independently 
of the number of catalyzer particles or their arrangement.

\opt{back_rate \var{k_\text{back}}}
\variant{1} reaction off
\begin{features}
  \required{REACTIONS}
\end{features}
\end{essyntax}

Variant \variant{0} defines a reaction with particles of type number \var{rt} 
as reactant, type \var{ct} as catalyzer and type \var{pt} as product. The 
reaction rate is given by \var{r} and to override the dynamically determined 
rate for the back reaction, one can specify it by \var{k_\text{back}}.

Variant \variant{1} disables the reaction. Note that at the moment, there can 
only be one reaction in the simulation.
