  abstract = {In the molecular dynamics simulation method for fluids, the equations
	of motion for a collection of particles in a fixed volume are solved
	numerically. The energy, volume, and number of particles are constant
	for a particular simulation, and it is assumed that time averages
	of properties of the simulated fluid are equal to microcanonical
	ensemble averages of the same properties. In some situations, it
	is desirable to perform simulations of a fluid for particular values
	of temperature and/or pressure or under conditions in which the energy
	and volume of the fluid can fluctuate. This paper proposes and discusses
	three methods for performing molecular dynamics simulations under
	conditions of constant temperature and/or pressure, rather than constant
	energy and volume. For these three methods, it is shown that time
	averages of properties of the simulated fluid are equal to averages
	over the isoenthalpic-isobaric, canonical, and isothermal-isobaric
	ensembles. Each method is a way of describing the dynamics of a certain
	number of particles in a volume element of a fluid while taking into
	account the influence of surrounding particles in changing the energy
	and/or density of the simulated volume element. The influence of
	the surroundings is taken into account without introducing unwanted
	surface effects. Examples of situations where these methods may be
	useful are discussed.},

  abstract = {We introduce a regularization procedure to define electrostatic energies
	and forces in a slab system of thickness h that is periodic in two
	dimensions and carries a net charge. The regularization corresponds
	to a neutralization of the system by two charged walls and can be
	viewed as the extension to the two-dimensional (2D)+h geometry of
	the neutralization by a homogeneous background in the standard three-dimensional
	Ewald method. The energies and forces can be computed efficiently
	by using advanced methods for systems with 2D periodicity, such as
	MMM2D or P3M-ELC, or by introducing a simple background-charge correction
	to the Yeh???Berkowitz approach of slab systems. The results are
	checked against direct lattice sum calculations on simple systems.
	We show, in particular, that the Madelung energy of a 2D square charge
	lattice in a uniform compensating background is correctly reproduced
	to high accuracy. A molecular dynamics simulation of a sodium ion
	close to an air-water interface is performed to demonstrate that
	the method does indeed provide consistent long-range electrostatics.
	The mean force on the ion reduces at large distances to the image-charge
	interaction predicted by macroscopic electrostatics. This result
	is used to determine precisely the position of the macroscopic dielectric
	interface with respect to the true molecular surface},

	reduces to the second-order Langevin equation. The latter is shown
