#================= TO DO ================
#
# 1.  Check file of bug reports and requests


# The above code allows this script to be run under UNIX/LINUX without
# the need to adjust the path to the perl program in a "shebang" line.
# (The location of perl changes between different installations, and
# may even be different when several computers running different
# flavors of UNIX/LINUX share a copy of latex or other scripts.)  The
# script is started under the default command interpreter sh, and the
# evals in the first two lines restart the script under perl, and work
# under various flavors of sh.  The -x switch tells perl to start the
# script at the first #! line containing "perl".  The "if 0;" on the
# 3rd line converts the first two lines into a valid perl statement
# that does nothing.

# To do: 
#   Rationalize again handling of include files.
#     Perhaps use kpsewhich to do searches.
#        (How do I avoid getting slowed down too much?)
#     Better parsing of log file for includes.
#   Do I handle the recursive dependence of bbl and aux files sensibly.
#     Perhaps some appropriate touching of the .aux and .bbl files would help?
#   Document the assumptions at each stage of processing algorithm.
#   Option to restart previewer automatically, if it dies under -pvc
#   Test for already running previewer gets wrong answer if another
#     process has the viewed file in its command line

##   For Win95 et al.:  Remaining items on list.
##     1.  See specific flags
##     6.  Need to check out all calls to system
##     8.  Now check that I do the bibtex and index stuff correctly.
##     9.  Convert routines to have arguments.
##    12.  Need to have default filetypes for graphics includes.
##         To make that rational, the find_file routine, etc must be modified,
##         otherwise there will be much duplication of code.
##
##
##   NEW FEATURES, since v. 2.0:
##     1.  Correct algorithm for deciding how many times to run latex:
##         based on whether the aux file changes between runs
##     2.  Continuous preview works, and can be of ps file or dvi file
##     3.  pdf creation by pdflatex possible
##     4.  Defaults for commands are OS dependent.
##     5.  Parsing of log file instead of source file is used to
##         obtain dependencies, by default.
##     6.  Meta-commands in source file
##
##           %#{}raw
##           %#{}begin.raw
##              Start section of raw LaTeX: treat as %#{latex}begin.ignore.
##
##           %#{}end.raw     
##              End section of raw LaTeX: treat as %#{latex}end.ignore.
##
##           %#{latexmk}ignore
##           %#{latexmk}begin.ignore
##              Start section that is to be ignored in scanning dependencies. 
##           %#{latexmk}end.ignore
##              End section that is to be ignored in scanning dependencies. 
##
##           %#{latexmk}include.file FILE
##           %#{latexmk}input.file FILE
##              Add FILE to list of include files.  (FILE is separated from 
##              the keyword "include.file" or "input.file" by white space, 
##              and is terminated by end-of-line or whitespace.)

##         -pv and -pvc override each other.  (Easier than making them

##         Die if incorrect option specified on command line.
##         Turn off bibtex mode if no .bib files specified in .aux

##            of input files. 
##         In force_mode, don't die when files are not found; they may
##            be in a search path where I don't look.  (But I have only
##            done this for the case that I parse the log file.)
##         When files for viewing, converting (dvi to ps, etc), etc are 
##            not found, give a warning rather than trying to continue.
##         Revise parsing in .log file to allow filenames with spaces.

##         Add "_switch" to names of configuration variables giving switches
##           (to avoid confusion with variables specifying commands).
##           E.g., latex_silent_switch
##         -P pdf switch on dvips, to ensure correct type 1 font generation
##           (otherwise pdf files have type 3 fonts, and look bad on screen).
##         Correct running of ps filter.  
##             It now only runs when ps file is updated.
##         Some clean-ups of code.
##         Allow preview of multiple files
##         Option to generate pdf file by ps2pdf (switch -pdfps)
##         Prevent detached previewer from responding to ctrl/C given to

##
##   1998-2001, John Collins.  Many improvements and fixes.
##
##   Modified by Evan McLean (no longer available for support)
##   Original script (RCS version 2.3) called "go" written by David J. Musliner
##
## 2.0 - Final release, no enhancements.  LatexMk is no longer supported
##       by the author.
## 1.9 - Fixed bug that was introduced in 1.8 with path name fix.
##     - Fixed buglet in man page.
## 1.8 - Add not about announcement mailling list above.
##     - Added texput.dvi and texput.aux to files deleted with -c and/or
##       the -C options.
##     - Added landscape mode (-l option and a bunch of RC variables).
##     - Added sensing of "\epsfig{file=...}" forms in dependency generation.
##     - Fixed path names when specified tex file is not in the current
##       directory.
##     - Fixed combined use of -pvc and -s options.
##     - Fixed a bunch of speling errors in the source. :-)
##     - Fixed bugs in xdvi patches in contrib directory.
## 1.7 - Fixed -pvc continuous viewing to reattach to pre-existing
##       process correctly.
##     - Added $pscmd to allow changing process grepping for different
##       systems.
## 1.6 - Fixed buglet in help message
##     - Fixed bugs in detection of input and include files.
## 1.5 - Removed test message I accidentally left in version 1.4
##     - Made dvips use -o option instead of stdout redirection as some
##       people had problems with dvips not going to stdout by default.
##     - Fixed bug in input and include file detection
##     - Fixed dependency resolution process so it detects new .toc file
##       and makeindex files properly.
##     - Added dvi and postscript filtering options -dF and -pF.
##     - Added -v version commmand.
## 1.4 - Fixed bug in -pvc option.
##     - Made "-F" option include non-existant file in the dependency list.
##       (RC variable: $force_include_mode)
##     - Added .lot and .lof files to clean up list of extensions.
##     - Added file "texput.log" to list of files to clean for -c.
##     - LatexMk now handles file names in a similar fashion to latex.
##       The ".tex" extension is no longer enforced.
##     - Added $texfile_search RC variable to look for default files.
##     - Fixed \input and \include so they add ".tex" extension if necessary.
##     - Allow intermixing of file names and options.
##     - Added "-d" and banner options (-bm, -bs, and -bi).
##       (RC variables: $banner, $banner_message, $banner_scale,
##       $banner_intensity, $tmpdir)
##     - Fixed "-r" option to detect an command line syntax errors better.
## 1.3 - Added "-F" option, patch supplied by Patrick van der Smagt.
## 1.2 - Added "-C" option.
##     - Added $clean_ext and $clean_full_ext variables for RC files.
##     - Added custom dependency generation capabilities.
##     - Added command line and variable to specify custom RC file.
##     - Added reading of rc file in current directly.
## 1.1 - Fixed bug where Dependency file generation header is printed
##       rependatively.
##     - Fixed bug where TEXINPUTS path is searched for file that was
##       specified with absolute an pathname.
## 1.0 - Ripped from script by David J. Musliner (RCS version 2.3) called "go"
##     - Fixed a couple of file naming bugs
##        e.g. when calling latex, left the ".tex" extension off the end
##             of the file name which could do some interesting things
##             with some file names.
##     - Redirected output of dvips.  My version of dvips was a filter.
##     - Cleaned up the rc file mumbo jumbo and created a dependency file
##       instead.  Include dependencies are always searched for if a
##       dependency file doesn't exist.  The -i option regenerates the
##       dependency file.
##       Getting rid of the rc file stuff also gave the advantage of
##       not being restricted to one tex file per directory.
##     - Can specify multiple files on the command line or no files
##       on the command line.
##     - Removed lpr options stuff.  I would guess that generally,
##       you always use the same options in which case they can
##       be set up from an rc file with the $lpr variable.
##     - Removed the dviselect stuff.  If I ever get time (or money :-) )
##       I might put it back in if I find myself needing it or people
##       express interest in it.
##     - Made it possible to view dvi or postscript file automatically
##       depending on if -ps option selected.
##     - Made specification of dvi file viewer seperate for -pv and -pvc
##       options.

    # The problem is a mixed MSWin32 and UNIX environment. 
    # Perl decides the OS is cygwin in two situations:
    # 1. When latexmk is run from a cygwin shell under a cygwin
    #    environment.  Perl behaves in a UNIX way.  This is OK, since
    #    the user is presumably expecting UNIXy behavior.  
    # 2. When CYGWIN exectuables are in the path, but latexmk is run
    #    from a native NT shell.  Presumably the user is expecting NT
    #    behavior. But perl behaves more UNIXy.  This causes some
    #    clashes. 
    # The issues to handle are:
    # 1.  Perl sees both MSWin32 and cygwin filenames.  This is 
    #     normally only an advantage.
    # 2.  Perl uses a UNIX shell in the system command
    #     This is a nasty problem: under native NT, there is a
    #     start command that knows about NT file associations, so that
    #     we can do, e.g., (under native NT) system("start file.pdf");
    #     But this won't work when perl has decided the OS is cygwin,
    #     even if it is invoked from a native NT command line.  An
    #     NT command processor must be used to deal with this.
    # 3.  External executables can be native NT (which only know
    #     NT-style file names) or cygwin executables (which normally
    #     know both cygwin UNIX-style file names and NT file names,
    #     but not always; some do not know about drive names, for
    #     example).
    #     Cygwin executables for tex and latex may only know cygwin
    #     filenames. 
    # 4.  The BIBINPUTS and TEXINPUTS environment variables may be
    #     UNIX-style or MSWin-style depending on whether native NT or
    #     cygwin executables are used.  They are therefore parsed
    #     differently.  Here is the clash:
    #        a. If a user is running under an NT shell, is using a
    #           native NT installation of tex (e.g., fptex or miktex),
    #           but has the cygwin executables in the path, then perl
    #           detects the OS as cygwin, but the user needs NT
    #           behavior from latexmk.
    #        b. If a user is running under an UNIX shell in a cygwin
    #           environment, and is using the cygwin installation of
    #           tex, then perl detects the OS as cygwin, and the user
    #           needs UNIX behavior from latexmk.
    #     Latexmk has no way of detecting the difference.  The two
    #     situations may even arise for the same user on the same

    # I don't need to know whether I run latex or pdflatex!
    #
    # Repeat running latex as many times as needed to resolve cross
    # references, also running bibtex and makeindex as necessary.  The
    # algorithm for determining whether latex needs to be run again is
    # whether certain generated files have changed since the previous
    # run.  A limit (contained in $max_repeat) is applied on the
    # number of runs, to avoid infinite loops in pathological cases or
    # in the case of a bug.  $max_repeat should be at least 4, to
    # allow for the maximum number of repeats under normal
    # circumstances, which is 3, plus one for unusual cases of page
    # breaks moving around.  
    #
    # The criterion for needing a rerun is that one or both of the
    # .aux file and the .idx file has changed.  To prove this: observe
    # that reruns are necessary because information that needs to be
    # read in from a file does not correspond to the current
    # conditions.  The relevant files are: the .aux file, and possibly
    # one or more of: the index files, the table of contents file
    # (.toc), the list of figures file (.lof), the list of tables file
    # (.lot).  The information read in is: cross reference
    # definitions, page references, tables of contents, figures and
    # tables.  Note that the list of figures (for example) may itself
    # contain undefined references or incorrect page references.  If
    # there is any incorrectness, changed information will be written
    # to the corresponding file on the current run, and therefore one
    # or more of the auxiliary files will have changed.  
    #
    # In fact the lines in the .toc, .lof and .lot files correspond to
    # entries in the .aux file, so it is not necessary to check the
    # .toc, .lof and .lot files (if any).  However WHETHER these files 
    # are input by latex is not determined by the aux file, but does
    # affect the output.  It is possible for the tex file to change
    # the state of one of the .toc, .lof, or .lot files between begin
    # required and not required.  The same could happen for other
    # input files.  
    #
    # For example, initially suppose no TOC is required, and that all
    # generated files are up-to-date.  The .toc file is either not
    # present or is out-of-date.  Then change the source file so
    # that a TOC is requested.  Run latex; it uses wrong TOC
    # information, but the .aux file might not change.  
    #
    # Two possibilities: (a) check .toc, .lof, .lot (possibly etc!)
    # files for changes; (b) check for a change in the list of input
    # files.  We'll choose the second: since it requires less file
    # checking and is more general.  It applies in all situations
    # where the extra auxiliary input files (e.g., .toc) correspond in
    # contents to the state of the .aux file, but only if these files
    # are used. 
    #
    # Therefore a correct algorithm is to require a rerun if either of
    # the following is true:
    #
    #    1.  The .aux file has changed from the previous run.
    #    2.  The .idx file has changed from the previous run.
    #    3.  The set of input files has changed from the previous run.
    #
    # Of course, if a previous version of one of these files did not
    # exist (as on a first run), then that implies a rerun is
    # necessary. And if a .aux file or a .idx file is not generated,
    # there is no point in testing it against a previous version.
    #
