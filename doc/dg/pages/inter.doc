		Particles placed exactly on top of each other will be
		subject to a force of magnitude \f$ maxforce \f$
		applied in \f$ \pm x \f$ direction.
		To return to the uncapped potential you have to set \f$  maxforce \f$ to zero using

\subsection tcl_tabulated Tabulated potential
	\verbatim tabulated <filename> \endverbatim	
		An arbitrary tabulated non-bonded pair potential.
		
		To use this potential you must provide a file which
		contains the tabulated forces and energies as a
		function of the separation distance.

		At present the required file format is simply an
		ordered list separated by whitespace. The data reader
		first looks for a \p # character and begins reading
		from that point in the file. Anything before the \p #
		will be ignored.

		The first parameter you should supply in the file is
		the number of data points in the table.  This should
		be an integer.  Take care when choosing an appropriate
		value for the number of points remembering that a copy
		of each lookup table is kept on each node and must be
		referenced very frequently.

		The second parameter you should supply is the minimum
		tabulated separation distance. The third parameter
		should be the maximum tabulated separation distance
		This will act as the effective cutoff value for the
		potential.  Between minval and maxval the force and
		energy are assumed to be tabulated at fixed intervals
		such that the size of this interval is given by:

		\f$ \frac{(maxval - minval)}{n-1} \f$

		Where \f$ n \f$ is the number of data points in the table
	
		The remaining data in the file should consist of n
		data triples \<distance\> \<force\> \<energy\>.  Note
		that distance is only included for human readability
		of the file. Its values do not matter but it must be
		present to satisfy the file read format. In the future
		a more structured file format will be required for the
		tabulated input file. The values of force and energy
		should be given as follows:

		force: 	\f$ -\frac{U'(r)}{r}\f$   

		energy:       \f$U(r) \f$ 

		Needs feature TABULATED compiled in (see \ref config.h).
		\warning This feature has not been fully
		tested. Please use with care.

\subsection tcl_gb Gay-Berne potential

		the Gay-Berne potential for prolate and oblate particles.
		The Gay-Berne potential is an anisotropic version of the classic Lennard-Jones potential,

		The parameters \f$ \chi = \frac{k_1^{2} - 1}{k_1^{2} +
		1 } \f$ and \f$ \chi' = \frac{k_2^{1/\mu} -
		1}{k_2^{1/\mu} + 1 } \f$ are responsible for the

		k_1 \f$ is the molecular elongation, and \f$ k_2 \f$
		is the ratio of the potential well depths for the
		side-by-side and end-to-end configurations. Exponents
		\f$ \mu \f$ and \f$ \nu \f$ are adjastable parameters

		     or

		     This is an implementation of the 1/r Coulomb potential
		     \f[ U^{C-P3M} = \ell_B T \frac{q_1 q_2}{r} \f]
		     with help of the P3M Method described elsewhere. 

		     Make sure you know how to tune p3m parameters before
		     using the automatic tuning feature. Details are
		     described in the documentation of \ref
		     P3M_tune_parameters rsp \ref P3M_adaptive_tune_parameters.

		     The two tuning methods follow different methods for determining the optimal parameter. While the tune version
		     simply tries out different values on a grid in the parameter space, the tunev2 version uses a bisection to
		     determine the optimal parameters. In general, for small systems the tune version is faster, while for large
		     systems tunev2 is faster. The results of tunev2 are always at least as good as the parameters achievable from
		     the tune version, and normally the obtained accuracy is much closer to the desired value.

		     Note that any previous settings of r_cut, cao and mesh will be remembered. So if you want to retune your
		     electrostatics, e. g. after a major system change, you should use
		     \verbatim inter coulomb <bjerrum> p3m tune accuracy <acc> r_cut 0 mesh 0 cao 0\endverbatim 

		     Some additional p3m parameters have preset values:
		     \verbatim epsilon = metallic \endverbatim 
		     The dielectric constant of the surrounding medium, metallic (i.e.infinity) or some finite
	             positive number.
		     \verbatim n_interpol = 32768 \endverbatim 
		     Number of interpolation points for the charge assignment function. When this is set to 0, interpolation is turned off.
		     \verbatim mesh_off = 0.5 0.5 0.5 \endverbatim 
		     Offset of the first mesh point from the lower left corner of the simulation box
		     in units of the mesh constant.
		     As soon as p3m is turned on the additional parameters can be changed with:

			explicitly given, it is determined from the maximal pairwise error, otherwise this error only
			counts for the near formula. The second, tuning form just takes the maximal pairwise error and
			tries out a lot of switching radii to find out the fastest one. If this takes too long, you can
			change the value of the setmd variable "timings" which controls the number of test force calculations.
			For details, see \ref MMM_general.

		     This is an implementation of the instantaneous 1/r Coulomb interaction
		     \f[ U = \ell_B T \frac{q_1 q_2}{r} \f]
		     as the potential of mean force between charges which are dynamically coupled to a local
		     electromagnetic field. 
	
	             \<f_mass\> is the mass of the field degree of freedom and equals to the square root of the inverted speed of light.

                     \<mesh\> is the number of mesh points for the interpolation of the electromagnetic field

	             \<field_friction\> value of the friction coefficient for the transversal field degrees of freedom (reserved for future developments)

                     Unphysical self--energies,
		     arised as a result of the lattice interpolation  of charges, are corrected by a subtraction scheme
		     based either on the exact lattice Green's function or the combination of the direct subtraction scheme plus the Yukawa subtraction scheme (second method).

		    For the case of Yukawa screened simulation (second method) one has  to enter screening parameter \<kappa\> and
		    the cut-off of the Yukawa potential \<r_cut\>

\subsection tcl_ELC ELC		
	    \verbatim inter coulomb elc <maximal pairwise error> <gap size> {<far cutoff>} \endverbatim
		This is a special procedure that converts a 3d method, i. e. P3M at the moment, to a 2d method, in computational order N. This
		is definitely faster than MMM2D for larger numbers of particles (>400 at reasonable accuracy requirements). The
		maximal pairwise error is the LUB error of the force between any two charges without prefactors (see the papers).
		The gap size gives the height of the empty region between the system box and the neighboring artificial images
		(again, see the paper). Espresso does <em>not</em> make sure that the gap is actually empty, this is the users responsibility.
	 	The method will compute fine of the condition is not fulfilled, however, the error bound will not be reached. Therefore you
		should really make sure that the gap region is empty (e. g. by constraints). The far cutoff finally is only intended for
		testing and allows to directly set the cutoff. In this case, the maximal pairwise error is ignored. The periodicity has to be
		set to 1 1 1 still, and the 3d method has to be set to epsilon metallic, i.e. metallic boundary conditions. For details,
		see \ref MMM_general.

\section tcl_other_inter Other interaction types 
	<ul>
	    <li>\verbatim inter <particle_type_number1> <particle_type_number1> comfixed <comfixed_flag> \endverbatim
      This interaction type applies a constraint on particles of type particle_type_number1 such that during the integration the center of mass of these particles is fixed. This is accomplished as follows: The sum of all the forces acting on particles of type particle_type_number1 are calculated. These include all the forces due to other interaction types and also the thermostat. Next a force equal in magnitude, but in the oppositte direction is applied on the particles. This force is divided equally on all the particles of type particle_type_number1, since currently there is no mass concept in Espresso. Note that the syntax of the declaration of comfixed interaction requires the same particle type to be input twice. If different particle types are given in the input, the program exits with an error message. The comfixed_flag can be set to 1 (which turns on the interaction) or 0 (to turn off the interaction).
        
	    <li>\verbatim inter <particle_type_number1> <particle_type_number2> comforce <comforce_flag> 
      <comforce_dir> <comforce_force> <comforce_fratio>\endverbatim
      The comforce interaction type enables one to pull away particle groups of two different types. It is mainly designed for pulling experiments on budles. Within a bundle of molecules of type number 1 (t1) lets mark one molecule as of type 2 (t2). Using comforce one can apply a force such that t2 can be pulled away from the bundle. 
      The comforce_flag is set to 1 to turn on the interaction, and to 0 otherwise. 
      The pulling can be done in two different directions. Either parallel to the major axis of the bundle ( comforce_dir = 0) or perpendicular to the major axis of the bundle (comforce_dir = 1).
      comforce_force is used to set the magnitude of the force.
      comforce_fratio is used to set the ratio of the force applied on particles of t1 vs t2. This is useful if one has to keep the total applied force on the bundle and on the target molecule the same. A force of magnitude comforce_force is applied on t2 particles, and a force of magnitude (comforce_force * comforce_fratio) is applied on t1 particles.
	</ul>
