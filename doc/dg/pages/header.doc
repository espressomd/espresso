/** \mainpage ESPResSo Developer's Guide

This is the developer's guide of ESPResSo. It is primarily intended
for people that want to extend or just understand the C-code of
ESPResSo, or that want to change the documentation.

If you just have obtained a release of ESPResSo, and you are looking
for documentation on how to use ESPResSo, you might first want to have
a look at the User's Guide, which is to be found in \c doc/ug/ug.pdf
in the ESPResSo release.

\section development_tools Required development tools

If you want to participate in the development of ESPResSo, you will
require the following tools depending on what tasks you want to
perform:

- to be able to access the development version of ESPResSo, you will
  need the distributed versioning control system <a
  href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>.
- to build ESPResSo from the development sources, you will furthermore
  need not too old versions of the GNU tools <a
  href="http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/">automake</a> and <a
  href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/autoconf.html"
  >autoconf</a> installed on your system.
- to be able to compile the User's Guide (when you made changes to the
  documentation), you will need a LaTeX-installation (all recent ones
  will do). For details, refer to \ref ug.
- to compile the Developer's Guide, you will need to have <a
  href="http://www.doxygen.org/">doxygen</a> installed

All of these tools should be easy to install on most Unix operating
systems.

\section contact Getting into contact and obtaining the development version

The first thing that you should do when you want to start to
participate, is to get into contact with the ESPResSo developers. Just
write a short email to ESPResSo's developers' mailing list
espressomd-devel@nongnu.org where you state you experience
with simulations and programming and the things that you would like to
do in ESPResSo. We do not bite, and we are happy about anybody who
wants to participate!

When you have done that, you can subscribe to the developer's mailing
list <a
href="http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/espressomd-devel"
>here</a>. The subscription is activated only after it is confirmed by
one of the list administrators, so please give us a few hours!

\section further_reading Further reading

After you have obtained the source code, you can start to work on the
source code. 
you might want to read some
or all of the following pages:

- \ref progguide
- \ref ug
- \ref our_doxygen
- \ref new_files
- \ref build_system

\section entry Entry points to the C-code

The script is interpreted on one node, the master node, whereas the
other nodes wait for the master node to issue specific actions,
i. e. a client-server model is utilized. More details can be found in
\ref communication.h "communication.h". During the actual integration,
however, the communication is done synchronously.  For more details
see \ref integrate.c "integrate.c".
