/** \page writepdb Writing pdb/psf files
    The PDB (Brookhaven Protein DataBase) format is a widely used
    format for describing atomic configurations. PSF is a format
    that is used by VMD to describe the topology of a PDB file.
    You need the PDB and PSF files for example for \ref tcl_imd.

\anchor tcl_writepsf
\verbatim
writepsf <file> { <N_P> <MPC> <N_CI> <N_pS> <N_nS> }|-molecule
\endverbatim
writes the current topology to the file \<file\> (here \<file\> is not
a channel since additional information cannot be written anyways).
\<N_P\>, \<MPC\> and so on are parameters describing a system consisting
of equally long charged polymers, counterions and salt. This information
is used to set the residue name and can be used to color the atoms in VMD.
If you specify -molecule, the residue name is taken from the molecule
identity of the particle. Of course different kinds of
topologies can also be handled by modified versions of writepsf.

\anchor tcl_writepdb
\verbatim
writepdb <file>
\endverbatim
writes the corresponding particle data.

\anchor tcl_writepdbfoldchains
\verbatim
writepdbfoldchains <file> { < chain_start> <n_chains> <chain_length> <box_l> }
\endverbatim
Writes folded particle data where the folding is 
performed on chain centers of mass rather than single particles.
In order to fold in this way the chain topology and box length 
must be specified.  Note that this method is outdated. Use writepdbfoldtopo instead.

\anchor tcl_writepdbfoldtopo
\verbatim
writepdbfoldtopo <file> { <shift> } 
\endverbatim
Writes folded particle data where the folding is 
performed on chain centers of mass rather than single particles.
This method uses the internal box length and topology information from espresso.  If you wish to shift
particles prior to folding then supply the optional shift information.  Shift should be a three member tcl list consisting of x, y, and z shifts respectively and each number should be a floating point (ie with decimal point).
