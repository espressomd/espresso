NOTEWORTHY CHANGES SINCE v2.2.0b
================================

User-visible changes
--------------------

* The P3M algorithm for the electrostatic interaction (not for dipoles
  so far) now allows for non-cubic simulation boxes.

* The pressure tensor for P3M is computed correctly now.

* The virtual sites feature has been significantly extended and
  documented.  Virtual sites are particles that can interact with
  other particles but whose positions are not integrated via the
  normal integrator.  Instead, the positions are determined by the
  positions of other, "real" particles.  Virtual sites can either be
  set into the center of mass of a set of real particles (feature
  VIRTUAL_SITES_COM), or it can be set to an arbitrary location
  relative to another particle (VIRTUAL_SITES_RELATIVE).  This allows
  to create rigid structures within ESPResSo.

* Some constraints can now be made penetrable or reflecting.

* The build system has been overhauled and simplified.

  * "Espresso" is now the actual binary instead of a wrapper shell
    script that automatically calls MPI. This means that it is
    necessary to call "mpiexec" or "mpirun" youself to run ESPResSo in
    an MPI environment.

  * The directory where the scripts are installed is now compiled into
    the binary, i.e. it is not necessary anymore to set the
    environment variable ESPRESSO_SCRIPTS. Still, it will heed the
    environment variable if it is set.

  * Running "make check" will run the testsuite with a single number
    of processors, which gives a significant speedup. "configure" will
    try to determine the available number of CPUs/cores. If it can't,
    it will use 1 by default.

  * MPI recognition has changed. The build system first needs to find
    out how to compile an MPI binary. If it doesn't find out
    automatically, you can help it by setting the variable MPICC or
    LDFLAGS correctly.  Furthermore, it needs to know how to run an MPI
    binary.  If "mpiexec" is available, everything is fine.  If it is
    not, you can provide a script "mympiexec.sh" that behaves like
    mpiexec.

  * So far, when you built in the source directory, all files ended up
    in a subdirectory "obj.XXX", where XXX was some description of the
    processor you used.  This non-standard behavior has been removed.
    Instead, the files are generated directly in the source directory
    when compiling there.
    If you want to compile several binaries from a single source
    directory, you can use build directories as described in the
    User's Guide.

Organizational changes
----------------------

* The home page of ESPReSso has been relocated to

    http://espressomd.org

* The mailing list and source code repository have been moved to GNU
  Savannah. Furthermore, we have a bugtracker now. The development
  homepage is 

    https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/espressomd

* The maintenance of ESPResSo has been relocated from Torsten Stühn
  from the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research at Mainz to 

    Olaf Lenz <olenz@icp.uni-stuttgart.de>

  from the Institute for Computational Physics at Stuttgart University.

* The old "ESPResSo license" was removed, as it was not really a
  license, but only contained additions that were either non-binding
  or already contained in the GPL.

* The license was upgraded to GPLv3.

* The package was adapted to GNU standards. RELEASE_NOTES was moved
  aside to old/RELEASE_NOTES, instead, we will have the files
  ChangeLog and NEWS. NEWS will contain a description of the most
  noteworthy changes since the last release.

Changes visible for developers
------------------------------

* The source code repository has been moved from CVS to git, and it
  has moved to GNU Savannah (see above).

* The .c/.h/.cu source files have been moved to the subdirectory
  src/.

* The automatically generated files configure and Makefile.in are not
  part of the repository anymore.  A developer can generate them using
  the command "bootstrap.sh", which requires the GNU autotools
  (autoconf and automake).

* All functions that represent the interface to Tcl should follow the
  same naming conventions. These are described here:

    git log 3d4d6f31655a8d96e47c8f80e10f27f6b764f8df
