Issues:

- same in imd, should go out

- the documentation is currently only a PDF, we need the sources.
  That can be part of the UG, as it is short enough, or we could
  move all to the tutorials directory. Anyways, all new Tcl
  commands / interaction need to be documented in the UG.

- too much hard-coded in the samples, fix the scripts

Currently resolved:

- prepare_vmd_connection/writepdb were changed. That has nothing to do
  with FSI, so why is it there? Also, the code is actually wrong,
  and breaks e.g. being able to fold coordinates. So, I took it out.

- removed files like vmd.log, backup files etc that should not go to trunk.

- renamed directories to better fit Espresso.
