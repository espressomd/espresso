(a) July      21st, 2010.

New Features:
(d) = LB_ELECTROHYDRODYNAMICS: charge coupling scheme for Lattice-Boltzmann
    simulations. See publication Hickey et. al. (2010)
    Added new feature:
    LB_ELECTROHYDRODYNAMICS
    With this, you can use a coupling scheme to simulate electrostatics and
    hydrodynamics
    for electrophoresis without long-range interactions, simply in
    Lattice-Boltzmann.
    For each particle, a new 3D-parameter mu_E can be set and is stored in Variable
    p->p.mu_E[3]
    This parameter is added to the LB-force routine.
    Documentation yet to come.

Changes:
(a) added more reference to original adress papers

Bugfixes:
(h) ADDITIONAL_CHECKS now resets its variables, especially particle
    ids
(h) mmm2d now allows again to use the nsquare cellsystem, if no dielectric
    contrasts are specified
(g) dpd thermostats will also make particles interact
(f) virtual sites can now be coupled to the NPT integrator
(e) : Virtual sites inconsistent with AdResS
(e) : Added optimization and pressure profile (Todd, Evans and
    Davis)
(c) fixed sign of charged plate energy
(b) removed duplicated file in scripts/Makefile.am

    a molecule)
(g) common testsuite infrastructure for testing features and nprocs
    etc
(g) rotational particles now also store the director for faster computation of
    GB
(g) rotational inertia code by MJW

Changes:
(p) Metadynamics no longer relies on EXTERNAL forces.

Bugfixes:

(a) August    28th, 2008.

New Features:
(u) r_min for lennard-jones
(t) separated electro- and magnetostatics. Instead of configuring for either
    electrostatics or magnetostatics using the DIPOLES switch, there is now a
    switch MAGNETOSTATICS to activate magnetic dipolar interactions. Using both
    ELECTROSTATICS and MAGNETOSTATICS, it is now possible to run systems with
    charges and magnetic dipoles simulataneously.
(l) started a new documentation section "tutorials"
(l) added detection and compiler flags for Intel Atom CPU.
(j) harmonic spring now has a cutoff
(e) added tabulated adress force, tabulated correction function
(e) mmm2d with dielectric contrast now uses internally dielectric contrasts, which
    allows to specify metallic boundary conditions also. To set the contrasts
    directly, use the dielectric-contrasts option.
(c) included extended LJGEN potential in main cvs trunk
(c) updated generic lennard-jones interaction in users guide
(a) The tunable slip boundary module has been included into the main ESPResSo
    branch

Changes:
(k) harmonic cutoff is by default off, but still possible to set
(g) ELC with dielectric contrast now also prints out the space layer, and the out
    output can actually be fed back into inter coulomb as intended

Bugfixes:
(v) Fixed some documentation errors in the Lennard-Jones description. Thanks to
    Ahmad A. J. Agung!
(s) fixed a bug in "analyze energy coulomb" which would report a random
    energy/pressure if no electrostatics method is switched on.
(r) Re-added configure-ac and Makefile-am.in after dead revision
(r) Re-added acconfig.h.in to CVS
(r) included Makefile.in files again into CVS (this matter is still discussed and
    may change again in future)
(r) Resurrecting and re-adding several Makefile.in after dead
    revision
(r) Re-added scripts/Makefile.in after dead revision
(q) Configure can handle the situation when configure-ac is not
    executable.
(q) Fix in the LJ documenatation (thanks to David Sean and Antoine)
(p) Fixed a bug in writevsf related to the bond information.
(o) added a security warning for image charge correction, which requires the far
    formula to work
(n) Another bugfix on aggregation routine
(n) fixed a bug in aggregation routine
(m) fixed the distribution to also contain the sources for the
    tutorial
(m) fixed error message in case the hash line is missing
(i) fixed the harmonic-testcase to set a skin of 1 so that the bonding partners are
    always on the same node.
(h) dpd and adress global parameters have not been broadcasted correctly, when
    lattice was not defined.
(h) - fixed default weight for init_particle in particle_data.c
(g) ELC tuning now also works for ELC with dielectric contrast, and an stray
    constant force proportional to the charge sum was removed.
(g) Adjusted lj-generic test to new format of the lj-generic
    command
(f) calc_eigenvector_3x3 was accessing out-of-bounds stack memory for singular
    matrizes
(f) fixed several (justified) warnings of gcc-4.3
(f) fixed two bugs in mmm2d with dielectric interfaces. Calculations in the top
    layer were wrong so far
(e) the documentation now points out the dielectric features.
(d) forgotten adress flag
(b) In order to satisfy the dissipation-fluctuation theorem, DPD is not applied to
    fixed particles or particles that interact with fixed particles any
    more.

(k) molcut is now a normal interaction LJ_WITH_MOL_CUT and RF_WITH_MOL_CUT was
    removed
(k) ghost_flags has now ifdef GHOST_FLAG, virtual sites does not need it
    anymore
(j) more verbose and useful error messages for virtual sites

Bugfixes:
(v) fixed output of ELC parameters
(u) Added a check to rattle.h to make sure that time_step is defined before
    defining a rigid_bond.
(u) Added a check to angle.h for dot product exceeding 1.0 due to floating point
    arithmetic.
(t) wrong sign for torgue2
(r) CUTOFF_CHECK was in the wrong place for inter_rf, make a wrapper to use the
    same functions for rf and inter_rf
(q) Fixed a crash when constraints have the largest type in the system and no
    interaction is defined for them
(p) Fixed a crash when printing out the interactions with individual force capping
    switched on.
(o) get_mol_dist gives the wrong value on 1,2 cpus, due to a problem with
    local_particles
(m) molcut is a non-local feature, so calc_force must be different for pressure.h
    and forces.h
(l) too short max_cut for mol_cut
(k) espresso_logo.tcl now also works with online visualization.
(j) fixed compile error due to missing ifdef in ghosts.h
(g) make virtual sites work with mpi
(f) isVirtual was printed double in the part command
(d) wrong code_info for dpd_mass
(d) mass was missing in anaylze energy_kinetic
(b) ONEPART_DEBUG would not compile with LJ_ANGLE because of an undefined variable.
    Fixed.

(w) per default, new RW-system is used unless OLD_RW_VERSION is
    defined
(v) dpd_print works now with checkpoint
(u) removed debug-messages
(t) LB grid size change now correctly implemented - but not extensively
    tested.
(s) rigid bonds skip to many particles
(r) iccp3m_cfg was defined in the header file instead of declared.
(r) Definition is now in the c-file. This prevented compilation with gcc4.0 on
    MacOS
(r) moved unconditional #include <fttw3.h> into LB condition.
(r) This prevented compilation on systems without fftw3.h.
(r) Introduced the new calc_lj_shift function to replace our various
    ways
(r) of assigning random shifts to the LJ potential.
(q) fixed some minor issues in the new p3m iterative scheme iccp3m. Espresso
    compiles again.
(p) bug pressure calc of reaction field
(n) fixed the tutorial scripts in the user's guide.
(m) amd dual-core is supported now by config.guess
(l) Flowfield needs to be computed before calculating couplings. It has to persist
    throughout, because otherwise the parallelization does not
    work.
(k) define fix for BOND_VIRTUAL
(j) merge from trunc
(j) change to generalized reaction field
(j) rf output correction
(j) Reaction field bug fix
(j) bugfix from trunc
(j) wrong define
(i) added inter_dpd to code info
(i) code syntax error

(e) scale with time_step in analyze vel_distr
(b) stress tensor off by a factor of 3
(a) ESPResSo again compiles and runs with DIPOLES and ROTATION switched
    on.
(a) The blockfile_(tcl)variable_blacklist variable is now no longer silently
    created when writing a a (tcl)variable.
(a) Fixed the handling of single element lists in
    blockfile_write_(tcl)variable

New Features:
(y) added Reaction Field to Coulomb interactions
(y) added readline features (history, lineediting, tab, etc.) for interactive
    started Espresso
(w) Rewrote "How to write the User's Guide" in the Developer's
    Guide
(w) First version of the new User's Guide
(t) added possibility to respect constraints when setting up
    polymers
(n) added BMHTF (Born-Meyer-Huggins-Tosi-Fumi) NaCl potential.
(m) configuration now disables fftw with --without-fftw
(l) configure has now a flag --with-compilertype, to manually specify the compiler
    type in case
(l) the auto detection fails (e. g. mpicc + xlc)
(k) added smooth step potential.
(i) support for G4/ppc7450 on Apple
(h) analyze <g1>-<g3> now have a parameter -sliding for a sliding window analysis
    instead of averaging.
(g) New users guide
(d) added DPD thermostat with transversal damping and random force
(d) Added LU-decomposition for matrices. Can be used for
(d) solving linear equation systems.

Changes:
(y) added the feature "analyze bin all" to get a list of all particles, removed
    some prints to stdout and a Segmentation fault when calling "analyze bin"
    without argument.
(x) Major changes in Lattice Boltzmann implementation:
(x) 1) Changed the LB model from D3Q18 to D3Q19. D3Q19 is now the
(x) standard model. Switching to a different model is still
(x) possible, but MAKE SURE to #undefine the D3Q19 macro in order
(x) to use the generic implementation.
(x) 2) Removed CREEPING_FLOW macro. The implementation now always
(x) includes the nonlinear term in the equilibrium distribution.
(x) While the computational overhead is small, this term is
(x) necessary to retain Galilean invariance. Note that the
(x) exclusion of the nonlinear term had a stabilizing effect
(x) which now of course is absent as well.
(x) 3) Removed special treatment of negative populations.
(x) Negative populations are now always accepted. This avoids the
(x) need to redraw random numbers, which is a pain in the neck to
(x) parallelize and was actually never 100% correct. The code
(x) runs just fine with negative populations. If results get
(x) screwed up, the simulation parameters are probably physically
(x) insane. Try to reduce the time steps and/or the temperature
(x) in that case.
(w) Moved documentation of Tcl commands from Developer's guide (doxygen) to User's
    Guide (LaTeX)
(s) Adding the TRANS_DPD macro to switch on or off the transversal
    DPD
(e) replaced the \alph function with \arabic, allowing more than 26 hypertargets to
    be set in the ug.

Bugfixes:
(y) removed some printf to stdout in calc_bins_sphere()
(v) We actually use some bash features, so explicitely state it.
(u) resubmitted changes, now with proper #ifdefs
(r) under certain circumstances, MMM1D would allow to manual set impossible
    switching radii.
(r) corrected counting in writepsf() and writepdb()
(q) fixed a rare condition in which a particle would end up on a nonexistent node
    when close to the box boundaries.
(p) analyze structurefactor now outputs all wavevectors, even those with small
    S(q).
(p) Also fixed the function name, which was inconsistent between header file and
    implementation.
(o) Added necessary energy shift and fixed potential.
(o) fft.c depends heavily on p3m.c. So has to be included with
    ELP3M
(m) do not include svml with icc on Itanium, it doesn't exist
(m) CC environment variable can now override the MPI compiler
    again.
(m) This was broken during the switch to automake.
(k) in the dist-tgz, GPL.TXT and LICENSE.TXT were missing
(j) added missing allocations in stress tensor calculation.
(i) fixed buggy ntoh function.
(h) added error message if skin is larger than the layer height.
(f) fixed a problem with older checkpoint files and the transversale
    dpd
(d) added DPD thermostat to thermo_heat_up() and thermo_cool_down()
(d) for the same reason as the langevin thermostat
(c) When working with fixed particles and langevin thermostat, the forces of the
    fixed coordinates haven't been initialized. This is now
    corrected.
(b) minor bug in MBTOOLS-
(a) P3M: When using non-metallic boundary conditions, the computed
    energies were wrong because the diploar term goes in with the wrong
    sign.

(c) February 14th, 2007.
(b) February  6th, 2007.
(a) February  2nd, 2007.

New Features:
(y) added Reaction Field to Coulomb interactions
(y) added readline features (history, lineediting, tab, etc.) for interactive
    started Espresso
(w) Rewrote "How to write the User's Guide" in the Developer's
    Guide
(w) First version of the new User's Guide
(t) added possibility to respect constraints when setting up
    polymers
(n) added BMHTF (Born-Meyer-Huggins-Tosi-Fumi) NaCl potential.
(m) configuration now disables fftw with --without-fftw
(l) configure has now a flag --with-compilertype, to manually specify the compiler
    type in case
(l) the auto detection fails (e. g. mpicc + xlc)
(k) added smooth step potential.
(i) support for G4/ppc7450 on Apple
(h) analyze <g1>-<g3> now have a parameter -sliding for a sliding window analysis
    instead of averaging.
(g) New users guide
(d) added DPD thermostat with transversal damping and random force
(d) Added LU-decomposition for matrices. Can be used for
(d) solving linear equation systems.

Changes:
(y) added the feature "analyze bin all" to get a list of all particles, removed
    some prints to stdout and a Segmentation fault when calling "analyze bin"
    without argument.
(x) Major changes in Lattice Boltzmann implementation:
(x) 1) Changed the LB model from D3Q18 to D3Q19. D3Q19 is now the
(x) standard model. Switching to a different model is still
(x) possible, but MAKE SURE to #undefine the D3Q19 macro in order
(x) to use the generic implementation.
(x) 2) Removed CREEPING_FLOW macro. The implementation now always
(x) includes the nonlinear term in the equilibrium distribution.
(x) While the computational overhead is small, this term is
(x) necessary to retain Galilean invariance. Note that the
(x) exclusion of the nonlinear term had a stabilizing effect
(x) which now of course is absent as well.
(x) 3) Removed special treatment of negative populations.
(x) Negative populations are now always accepted. This avoids the
(x) need to redraw random numbers, which is a pain in the neck to
(x) parallelize and was actually never 100% correct. The code
(x) runs just fine with negative populations. If results get
(x) screwed up, the simulation parameters are probably physically
(x) insane. Try to reduce the time steps and/or the temperature
(x) in that case.
(w) Moved documentation of Tcl commands from Developer's guide (doxygen) to User's
    Guide (LaTeX)
(s) Adding the TRANS_DPD macro to switch on or off the transversal
    DPD
(e) replaced the \alph function with \arabic, allowing more than 26 hypertargets to
    be set in the ug.

Bugfixes:
(y) removed some printf to stdout in calc_bins_sphere()
(v) We actually use some bash features, so explicitely state it.
(u) resubmitted changes, now with proper #ifdefs
(r) under certain circumstances, MMM1D would allow to manual set impossible
    switching radii.
(r) corrected counting in writepsf() and writepdb()
(q) fixed a rare condition in which a particle would end up on a nonexistent node
    when close to the box boundaries.
(p) analyze structurefactor now outputs all wavevectors, even those with small
    S(q).
(p) Also fixed the function name, which was inconsistent between header file and
    implementation.
(o) Added necessary energy shift and fixed potential.
(o) fft.c depends heavily on p3m.c. So has to be included with
    ELP3M
(m) do not include svml with icc on Itanium, it doesn't exist
(m) CC environment variable can now override the MPI compiler
    again.
(m) This was broken during the switch to automake.
(k) in the dist-tgz, GPL.TXT and LICENSE.TXT were missing
(j) added missing allocations in stress tensor calculation.
(i) fixed buggy ntoh function.
(h) added error message if skin is larger than the layer height.
(f) fixed a problem with older checkpoint files and the transversale
    dpd
(d) added DPD thermostat to thermo_heat_up() and thermo_cool_down()
(d) for the same reason as the langevin thermostat
(c) When working with fixed particles and langevin thermostat, the forces of the
    fixed coordinates haven't been initialized. This is now
    corrected.
(b) minor bug in MBTOOLS-
(a) P3M: When using non-metallic boundary conditions, the computed
    energies were wrong because the diploar term goes in with the wrong
    sign.

(a) October  25th, 2006.

New Features:
(r) Support for mixed datatype SendRecv in mpifake. Very convenient
(r) for communicating subsets of vector datatypes in one shot
(r) (e.g. slices or subregions of a lattice).
(r) Includes packing/unpacking functions which might be useful
    elsewhere.
(p) added testcases for MMM2D/ELC with dielectric interfaces
    *ignore* fixed name output
(o) added "vec_rotate" function which rotates a 3d-vector around a given axis by
    some angle phi
(k) for (tcl)variable blocks there exist now global lists
    blockfile_(tcl)variable_blacklist
(k) which allow to to block the reading of variables during blockfile
    read.

(d) : analyze cwvac calculates the (charge-weighted) velocity auto-correlation.
    (see documentation for further info)
(c) mpifake now can drop error messages with file and line number information with
    gcc.
(c) For this, define GNU_MPIFAKE_DEBUG in myconfig.h.

Changes:
(m) The "FENE"-argument of the polymer and crosslink commands are
    called "bond" now, to reflect that any bonded interaction can
    be
    used. "FENE" does still work, however.
(i) Added syntax definition commands to the User's Guide.
(i) reading a variables block will now only issue a warning of min_num_cell or
    node_grid do not fit the current n_nodes
(g) fixed the Genuine Intel(R) CPU to match all Intel CPUs
(g) and added Core2 as Pentium_4. Should really be a new cpu,

(s) fixed header of samples/tutorial.tcl script
(q) require_feature now really works with multiple requirements
(o) angle-argument in polymer-command has been reprogrammed and should now work
    properly
(n) the SAW mode of the polymer now really sets up a SAW/PSAW. Since the PSAW
    change,
(n) it was only a RW within the other particles as obstacles.
(l) Fixed a bug in on_paramter_change where reinit_thermo was erroneously set to
    1.
(j) removed the >& which is not sh-compatible, and also not
    necessary.

(a) November 18th, 2005.

New Features:
(s) MOLFORCES: Various changes are made to options in the "analyze set trapmol"
    command....
(s) MOLFORCES: The trap position may be set to an absolute coordinate or it may be
    relative to the box size (useful for NPT simulations)
(s) MOLFORCES: A viscous drag (a force linearly proportional to the molecule
    velocity) may be applied to the molecule
(s) MOLFORCES: The net force acting on the molecule (including thermostat forces)
    can be canceled out  (i.e. surrounding particles cannot effect a molecules
    velocity but can effect other degrees of freedom).
(s) MOLFORCES: The forces applied by the trap on the molecule is summed over every
    time step.  The tcl command "analyze mol force" gives this sum of this applied
    force along with the number of time steps since it was last
    called.
(s) MOLFORCES: The centre of mass of a molecule is given by the "analyze mol com"
    command but only if the molecule is trapped.
(s) MBTOOLS: Various changes are made to MBTOOLS to incorporate the changes made to
    MOLFORCES.
(s) added gzip capability to polyBlockRead
(r) Added convenience Tcl-functions require_feature and has_feature
(j) Added Power5 architecture to configure-scripts
(h) added new tcl-command "replacestdchannel" which replaces one of TCLs standart
    I/O-channels with a named pipe
(g) added a pore constraint similar to the cylinder.
(d) Added Sandeep's modifications to MMM2D for dielectric
    contrasts.
(d) testcase for non-neutral charged 2d systems with a homogenous background
    (exerts a force towards the center !)
(b) ESPResSo is now also optimized for Celeron processors.
(a) Added 'analyze stress_tensor' returning the 9 components of the (total or detailed) 
    stress tensor (whose trace corresponds to the scalar pressure from 'analyze pressure').
(a) Added everywhere the part of the calculation of the intra- and inter- molecular 
    nonbonded pressure and stress tensor.
(a) Added the parse part of stress tensor ("print_detailed_stress_tensor, "parse_and_print_stress_tensor").
(a) Created new struct "Observable_stat_non_bonded" used in the calculation of intra- 
    and inter- molecular nonbonded contributions to scalar pressure and stress tensor.
(a) Added "*obsstat_non_bonded_intra" and "*obsstat_non_bonded_inter" pointers.

Changes:
(s) Modifications are made to the MOLFORCES option such that it works in
    parallel.
(o) Added communicator for temporary particle data (e.g. random numbers). No abuse
    of other communicators necessary any more.
(a) Change all the (scalar) pressure routines to calculate also the stress tensor.
(a) Change the parse part of pressure ("print_detailed_pressure, "parse_and_print_pressure") 
    to print out new "nonbonded" terms.
(a) Change mpi_gather_stats to be able to gather data im multiple arrays.
(a) The testcase 'analysis.tcl' now also checks the result of 'analyze stress_tensor'.

Bugfixes:
(t) fixed some ifdef EXTERNAL_FORCES conflicts
(s) Forgot to add molforces to lists of C source files in Makefile when commiting
    previous changes
(s) Fixed the capping of the lj-cos2 force
(s) Added the LJCOS2 option (commented out) to config.h
(s) not enough memory was allocated before a strcpy command
(q) again the -qipa problem on IBMs xlc compiler
(q) fixed again a minor -qipa problem in configure on IBMs xlc
    compiler
(p) Made fold_coordinate tolerant to rounding errors.
    Removed some lines introduced in rev 2.8, changed in rev 2.11.
    These lines could lead to particles sitting on the wrong
    processor
    after moving over periodic boundaries between processors, i.e.
    a
    coordinate -\epsilon was folded to L-\epsilon \approx L and
    then
    to zero.
    Now, rounding errors are tolerated, since the particle
    allocation
    scheme in domain_decomposition.c is robust as of rev 2.36.
(n) Fixed a randomly chosen part of code that has been copied into the heart of
    LinRegression.
(m) Fixed error in undoing the last step, when a negative lattice population is
    encountered.
(l) fixed a problem with socklen_t typedef on IBMs Power5 with AIX
    5.3
(i) fixed some minor problems with --disable-xlc-qipa, when using the xlc-compiler
    from IBM
(i) Fixed a nonconstant size local variable problem.
(f) In some cases, some lines in the static structure factor output were printed
    twice. (Thanks for the hint Leonid !)
(e) Fixed missing allocation in init_p_tensor
(c) Fixed a bug in "pressure.h" which caused the program to not compile when "MASS"
    was introduced in "config.h".

    called.
(s) MOLFORCES: The centre of mass of a molecule is given by the "analyze mol com"
    command but only if the molecule is trapped.
(s) MBTOOLS: Various changes are made to MBTOOLS to incorporate the changes made to
    MOLFORCES.
(s) added gzip capability to polyBlockRead
(r) Added convenience Tcl-functions require_feature and has_feature
(j) Added Power5 architecture to configure-scripts
(h) added new tcl-command "replacestdchannel" which replaces one of TCLs standart
    I/O-channels with a named pipe
(g) added a pore constraint similar to the cylinder.
(d) Added Sandeep's modifications to MMM2D for dielectric
    contrasts.
(d) testcase for non-neutral charged 2d systems with a homogenous background
    (exerts a force towards the center !)
(b) ESPResSo is now also optimized for Celeron processors.
(a) Added 'analyze stress_tensor' returning the 9 components of the (total or detailed) 
    stress tensor (whose trace corresponds to the scalar pressure from 'analyze pressure').
(a) Added everywhere the part of the calculation of the intra- and inter- molecular 
    nonbonded pressure and stress tensor.
(a) Added the parse part of stress tensor ("print_detailed_stress_tensor, "parse_and_print_stress_tensor").
(a) Created new struct "Observable_stat_non_bonded" used in the calculation of intra- 
    and inter- molecular nonbonded contributions to scalar pressure and stress tensor.
(a) Added "*obsstat_non_bonded_intra" and "*obsstat_non_bonded_inter" pointers.

Changes:
(s) Modifications are made to the MOLFORCES option such that it works in
    parallel.
(o) Added communicator for temporary particle data (e.g. random numbers). No abuse
    of other communicators necessary any more.
(a) Change all the (scalar) pressure routines to calculate also the stress tensor.
(a) Change the parse part of pressure ("print_detailed_pressure, "parse_and_print_pressure") 
    to print out new "nonbonded" terms.
(a) Change mpi_gather_stats to be able to gather data im multiple arrays.
(a) The testcase 'analysis.tcl' now also checks the result of 'analyze stress_tensor'.

Bugfixes:
(t) fixed some ifdef EXTERNAL_FORCES conflicts
(s) Forgot to add molforces to lists of C source files in Makefile when commiting
    previous changes
(s) Fixed the capping of the lj-cos2 force
(s) Added the LJCOS2 option (commented out) to config.h
(s) not enough memory was allocated before a strcpy command
(q) again the -qipa problem on IBMs xlc compiler
(q) fixed again a minor -qipa problem in configure on IBMs xlc
    compiler
(p) Made fold_coordinate tolerant to rounding errors.
    Removed some lines introduced in rev 2.8, changed in rev 2.11.
    These lines could lead to particles sitting on the wrong
    processor
    after moving over periodic boundaries between processors, i.e.
    a
    coordinate -\epsilon was folded to L-\epsilon \approx L and
    then
    to zero.
    Now, rounding errors are tolerated, since the particle
    allocation
    scheme in domain_decomposition.c is robust as of rev 2.36.
(n) Fixed a randomly chosen part of code that has been copied into the heart of
    LinRegression.
(m) Fixed error in undoing the last step, when a negative lattice population is
    encountered.
(l) fixed a problem with socklen_t typedef on IBMs Power5 with AIX
    5.3
(i) fixed some minor problems with --disable-xlc-qipa, when using the xlc-compiler
    from IBM
(i) Fixed a nonconstant size local variable problem.
(f) In some cases, some lines in the static structure factor output were printed
    twice. (Thanks for the hint Leonid !)
(e) Fixed missing allocation in init_p_tensor
(c) Fixed a bug in "pressure.h" which caused the program to not compile when "MASS"
    was introduced in "config.h".

New Features:
(s) MOLFORCES: Various changes are made to options in the "analyze set trapmol"
    command....
(s) MOLFORCES: The trap position may be set to an absolute coordinate or it may be
    relative to the box size (useful for NPT simulations)
(s) MOLFORCES: A viscous drag (a force linearly proportional to the molecule
    velocity) may be applied to the molecule
(s) MOLFORCES: The net force acting on the molecule (including thermostat forces)
    can be canceled out  (i.e. surrounding particles cannot effect a molecules
    velocity but can effect other degrees of freedom).
(s) MOLFORCES: The forces applied by the trap on the molecule is summed over every
    time step.  The tcl command "analyze mol force" gives this sum of this applied

(c) Released several commands to convert configurations to snapshots using Povray, 
    see /people/thnfs/homes/despintr/Espresso/scripts/pov.tcl for details.
    Most noticeable probably is 'writepov <output> [-folded [-box [-render]]]' which 
    takes the current particle setup and outputs a povray compatible file (including
    the box if '-box' is given) of all (folded) coordinates, and optionally renders it.
    Also available is 'morph <input1> <input2> <output> [<# of steps> [-render]]' which

    into <input2> over a series of (default:) 100 intermediate steps.
(b) Added 'bond_angle_min' which calculates the bond_angle between three particles 
    using the minimum image convention.

(d) writepov now checks whether the output file already exists

Bugfixes:
(i) Fixed bug in charge_aggregation. This tool can only be used when ELECTROSTATICS is compiled in. Therefore ifdefs are placed.
(e) Missing  variable for call to read_checkpoint_in for the case where  = 0 and where 
    is false
(e) Electrostatic tuning using tunev2 no longer crashes for 0 charges.
(d) the cutoff calculation for the complex sum was too high, but missing
(d) cutoff values for cases with very few cells, which can cause crashes
(d) one incr statement was missing
(c) Fixed tune_cells to work with min_num_cells. Backport from bench_v4.tcl.
(a) Fixed the forces initialization such that external forces are added 
    for all thermostats, not only Langevin.

(d) New ESPRESSO_PACKAGES environment variable can now be set to append a directory 
    to the tcl auto_path from where customized tcl-packages can be read.
(c) The 'polymer'-command now has a new, proper 'SAW'-mode which creates polymer chains
    exhibiting correct statistics of a self-avoiding random walk.
    The former implementation, also ensuring that excluded volume is observed but
    resulting in different propabilities for the chain conformations, remains
    available as 'PSAW' for performance reasons, as it is much faster than 'SAW'.
(b) Added to ELC a neutralizing background and an option to not calculate it.
    As usual, this is only interesting for nonneutral systems, although in 2D
    even a homogenous background generates a force in the nonperiodic dimension, 
    driving the particles towards the system center.

Changes:
(h) Changed the lipid_orient_order function so that it now takes a "all" flag 
    which causes it to print out the orientation of every lipid instead of just the average.
(g) Changed the interface for the orient_order command so that it now requires 
    an argument into which the complete set of orientations for all lipids will be written.
(f) Modified nbhood command so it now takes an optional planar argument.
(c) Changed default mode of the 'polymer'-command to the new, proper SAW-mode.
(c) Changed default shield-value of the 'polymer'-command to 1.0 (was: 0.0).
(a) Renamed the callbacks to slave_callbacks to avoid a naming collision with a SSI of LAM.

Bugfixes:
(j) Added missing output for the nonneutralization flag in ELC.
(e) Fixed a mistake in the check for the ESPRESSO_PACKAGES environment variable.
(c) Fixed the SAW-mode of the 'polymer'-command to now reflect real SAW-statistics.
(b) Fixed the plate energy in the constraints.

New Features:
(i) Now also Mobile Pentium processors are automatically recognized.
(e) Added the analyze bilayer_density_profile command and associated scripts in
    packages/mbtools to allow a vertical profile analysis of a lipid bilayer
(d) New ESPRESSO_PACKAGES environment variable can now be set to append a directory 
    to the tcl auto_path from where customized tcl-packages can be read.
(c) The 'polymer'-command now has a new, proper 'SAW'-mode which creates polymer chains
    exhibiting correct statistics of a self-avoiding random walk.
    The former implementation, also ensuring that excluded volume is observed but
    resulting in different propabilities for the chain conformations, remains
    available as 'PSAW' for performance reasons, as it is much faster than 'SAW'.

(c) May 11th, 2005.
(b) May  4th, 2005.
(a) May  3rd, 2005.

New Features:
(c) The main start-up script for Espresso, calling the actual binary in the subfolder
    apropriate for the current architecture, now features a dummy mode which thoroughly
    checks whether everything necessary (e.g. the environment variables ESPRESSO_SOURCE
    and ESPRESSO_SCRIPTS) is set, employing (hopefully) comprehensible error messages.
(b) Added an automatic parser which handels tcl-lists of doubles being sent to C.
(b) Added new command 'bin', which allows to analyze distributions by binning 
    given numbers into given subsets, e.g.
        bin -linbins 0 10 10 {0 0 2 3 1 7 3 1 1}
    for 10 bins [0,1], (1,2],...,(9,10], normalized to a weight of 1, 
        bin -linbins 0 10 10 {{0 1} {0 2} {2 1} {3 4} {1 1} {7 9} {3 4} {1 0} {1 1}}
    for sorting the second entries into the bin given by the first one, while
        bin -linbins 0 10 10 -binctrwdth 
    returns the centers and widths of the bins for pretty printing.
    Instead of -linbins you can also use -logbins or simply -bins, which takes a 
    list of bin boundaries as argument and allows for arbitrary bins.

Changes:
(g) When saving tcl-arrays using blockfiles, the keyword 'array' is now prepended to 
    each block to actually be able to use arrays at all. While this renders blockfiles
    written with v1.9.4g or higher _and_ including tcl-arrays incompatible with older 
    version, the reverse is not true as in older versions arrays could not be stored
    anyway.
(f) Changed the headers of all executable tcl-files (if not already done earlier)
    to have them use the new calling interface for ESPResSo via the main start-up
    script
    which also eliminates the need for distinguishing different parallel environments,
    as this is from now on done in the main start-up script itself.

Bugfixes:
(g) Fixed the handling of tcl-arrays being saved using blockfiles.
(e) Bugfix in the parsing of the P3M-option 'epsilon metallic' (it was ignored).
(d) Bugfix in the error formula for asymmetric boxes of MMM2D-applications.

    the checks for double, integer, etc. work.

    newly added 'INSTALL'-file.
(a) Added a generic MPI-environment for implementations which work simply 
    via 'mpicc' and 'mpirun' out of the box.

Changes:
(f) Added masses to 'blockfile read particles'.
(e) The 'el2d'- and 'P3M'-testcases now also check consistency of the energy calculation.
(e) MMM2D now uses a numerically stabilized treatment of the exponentials, 
    which should allow for highly asymmetric simulation boxes such as 10x10x10000.
(b) Testcase 'rotation.tcl' did not produce eventual errors correctly.
    Added an error if BOND_CONSTRAINT and ROTATION are used simultanously.
(b) The output of 'code_info' now also lists masses if available.

(c) Fixed a bug which prevented multiple Options to CFLAGS and LDFLAGS.
(c) Fixed a bug where the 'uwerr'-error analysis crashes for single row data.

    can have any type but is assumed to be either type 0 or the first bead in the molecule 
    where a type 0 bead takes preference.
(b) The output of 'part <part_id> bond' now also has its own code word, "bond".

    'bond_dihedral'       (calculates bond dihedral between particles p1, p2, p3 and p4)
    'create_dihedral_vec' (creates last vector of a dihedral (vec1, vec2, res))
(f) Changed assumptions in the lipid orientation calculation such that now the head bead 
    can have any type but is assumed to be either type 0 or the first bead in the molecule 
    where a type 0 bead takes preference.
(b) The output of 'part <part_id> bond' now also has its own code word, "bond". 
    Conversely, 'part <part_id> bond' now also accepts the output format as parameters, 
    e.g. "bond { { t1 p11 p12... } { t2 t21 t22... } }" is now a valid input.

Bugfixes:
(f) Finally fixed the DPD initialization bug: SQR(time_step) -> time_step.
    See also the mails from Ulf Schiller to the 'despresso'-mailing list.
(f) Fixed a problem with the lipid orientation calculation where the head bead 
    was assumed to always have type 0. Now the head bead can have any type but is assumed 
    to be either type 0 or the first bead in the molecule where a type 0 bead takes preference.
(f) Fixed a bug in 'try_delete_exclusion'.
(e) Fixed a bug in the dihedral forces. The new version is based on Arijits routines,
    although it is not yet certain if the energies are correct.
(b) Fixed the installation of directories ('scripts' and 'html_doc').
(b) Fixed the additional sources handling, i.e. MPI fake.
(a) Fixed a rare particle loss event.
(a) Fixed that 'make install' was missing a '\$'.


- v1.9.1b -
-----------

(b) March 23rd, 2005.
(a) March 21st, 2005.

New Features:
(b) Introduced an automatic configuration ability to ESPResSo.
    Now, executing './configure' in the root-directory will (attempt to) customize
    the program to the current working environment, identifying most of the commonly
    used compilers, parallel communicators, tcl-versions, etc.pp. required by itself.
    For details, see './configure --help'. 
    Note that in course of this, also the object file directory names have changed
    from the old '$ESPRESSO_SOURCE/Linux', '$ESPRESSO_SOURCE/Darwin', and so on,
    to 'obj-<cpu>-<vendor>-<os>'. There is, however, now a script in the source directory
    which will automatically start the correct binary and MPI-implementation for the 
    current architecture, provided it has been configured and compiled successfully.
(b) Introduced new option 'make install' which will install ESPResSo in the directories 
    specified using the new './configure'-ability. 
    The installed script contains the correct settings for $ESPRESSO_SOURCE and -SCRIPTS. 
(b) Informations on the production- and debug-status, the employed MPI-environment and
    FFTW-version are now also included in the output of the 'code_info'-command.

Changes:
(b) File '$ESPRESSO_SCRIPTS/scripts/aux.tcl' has been renamed to 'auxiliary.tcl' 
    for better compatibility with a certain brain damaged operating system 
    which doesn't like the other name 'cause it confuses it with the serial port of the PC.
(b) The internal structure of 'config.h' has been changed to allow better overview
    on the compilation status by separating documentation and flags (as done in 'debug.h').
(b) Changed makros FFTW_REAL and -IMAG for fftw3 to also work with systems/platforms
    where the complex data type is used. 
(b) Changed inclusion policy of header files: All files in ESPResSo are now required to
    include 'utils.h' which in turn will be the only one to include 'debug.h' and 'config.h'.

Bugfixes:
(b) Fixed some inportabilities such as spaces before #
(a) Small fixes in Lattice-Boltzmann part of the communication related to problems 
    with running on ALPHA-machines.

(c) January 21st, 2005.
(b) January 20th, 2005.
(a) January 19th, 2005.

New Features:
(a) Routines to compute dipolar energies, forces and torques with the P3M method
    have been added, embedded within a compiler flag DIPOLES to activate them
    (disabled by default, because this feature is still under development).
(a) Introduced 'on_observable_calc' to enforce re-calculation of number of charges.

Changes:
(b) The Debye-Hueckel-testcase now uses the nsquared cell system.
(b) Modified 'calc_3d_grid' such that it really returns an array in ascending order.

Bugfixes:
(e) Fixed 'comfixed.tcl' testsuite script. Now it actually integrates 
    and checks if comfixed is really working.
(e) Fixed a buffer overflow in MMM1D, P3M, pressure-calculation, 
    statistics, statistics_chain, topology.
(d) Fixed the molecule parser to accept its own output for particles not having a 'mol_id'.
    "off" is also accepted, if anybody wants to set it explicitly.
(c) Fixed a missing '#ifdef ELECTROSTATICS' in the 'initialize.c' file.
(b) Fixed the 'min_num_cells' feature for multi node processing.
(b) Fixed another P3M bug if the skin was changed after setting up P3M, so that
    P3M now honours changes to the skin.
(b) Fixed the additional checks in P3M to contain the skin.
(a) Fixed a severe bug that the charges for P3M and Maggs were only counted when 
    setting up the interaction. If the interactions were set up before setting up 
    the particles, the count of charged particles was always zero. 
    To help fixing this, a new 'on_observable_calc' was introduced.

(d) January  11th, 2005.
(c) January   6th, 2005.
(b) January   4th, 2005.
(a) December 27th, 2004.

New Features:
(f) Added some checks for the non verlet domain decomposition case.
(f) Added an entirely re-written version of the exclusions code.
(f) Added a generic P3M test case.
(e) Added background_error-codes: Every background error is now identified through its
    individual error code, which is always returned as the first entry in the list element
    containing the error message.
(c) Added option to specify position of 2nd monomer of first chain in the 'polymer'-command, 
    in case a certain direction of the polymer is desired (option makes only sense 
    if no more than one polymer is to be created).
(b) Added 2nd spherical bond angle in 'polymer'-command to allow creation of helixes or DNA.
(b) Added the Morse-potential to Espresso.
(a) Added new analysis routine
    'analyze cell_gpb <Manning parameter> <outer cell radius> <inner cell radius> [<accuracy> [<# of interations>]]'
    for determining the numerical solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation in the cell model.

Changes:
(f) Removed the buggy, non-interpolating version of the P3M charge assignment;
    anyways, the gain is only around 10%.
(f) Some improvements in the P3M charge assignment.
(d) Changed 'sprintf' in the runtime_errors to the new ERROR_SPRINTF-macro
(c) Reduced the minimal number of cells to the correct number 8.
(b) Reduced PARTICLE_INCREMENT to 8 as it does not cost anything, but reduces 
    the amount of memory used.
(b) RATTLE is slightly faster as the tolerance conditions are now verified 
    while the correction vectors are calculated.

Bugfixes:
(f) Fixed the square bug in P3M, which occurs for non-neutral systems.
(f) Fixed a rare event bug in tunev2 which could result in wrong parameter sets
    when there was only one possible parameter set for a mesh, and that was optimal.
(d) Fixed a bug which crashed analyze energy and pressure if the bonded interactions 
    had noncontigous numbers.
(d) Exclusions now also work without Verlet lists.
(d) Fixed the link cells routines to work with exclusions.
(b) Fixed a bug in rigid_bond_set_params(), where the velocity tolerance was not 
    multiplied by time_step; this led to inaccurate velocity corrections towards 
    the correct velocity tolerance.
(b) Fixed the handling of min_num_cells so that setting it updates the cell grid. 
    The check for illegal values happens earlier, preventing some background errors.
(b) Fixed a typographical error in on_ghost_flags_change() for activating the flag 
    'ghosts_have_v' for the case when BOND_CONSTRAINT is compiled in.
(b) Fixed the new tuning to correctly report the number of charges.

(b) RATTLE is slightly faster as the tolerance conditions are now verified 
    while the correction vectors are calculated.

Bugfixes:
(f) Fixed the square bug in P3M, which occurs for non-neutral systems.
(f) Fixed a rare event bug in tunev2 which could result in wrong parameter sets
    when there was only one possible parameter set for a mesh, and that was optimal.
(d) Fixed a bug which crashed analyze energy and pressure if the bonded interactions 
    had noncontigous numbers.
(d) Exclusions now also work without Verlet lists.
(d) Fixed the link cells routines to work with exclusions.
(b) Fixed a bug in rigid_bond_set_params(), where the velocity tolerance was not 
    multiplied by time_step; this led to inaccurate velocity corrections towards 
    the correct velocity tolerance.
(b) Fixed the handling of min_num_cells so that setting it updates the cell grid. 
    The check for illegal values happens earlier, preventing some background errors.
(b) Fixed a typographical error in on_ghost_flags_change() for activating the flag 
    'ghosts_have_v' for the case when BOND_CONSTRAINT is compiled in.
(b) Fixed the new tuning to correctly report the number of charges.

(f) January  15th, 2005.
(e) January  14th, 2005.
(d) January  11th, 2005.
(c) January   6th, 2005.
(b) January   4th, 2005.
(a) December 27th, 2004.

New Features:
(f) Added some checks for the non verlet domain decomposition case.
(f) Added an entirely re-written version of the exclusions code.
(f) Added a generic P3M test case.
(e) Added background_error-codes: Every background error is now identified through its
    individual error code, which is always returned as the first entry in the list element
    containing the error message.
(c) Added option to specify position of 2nd monomer of first chain in the 'polymer'-command, 
    in case a certain direction of the polymer is desired (option makes only sense 
    if no more than one polymer is to be created).
(b) Added 2nd spherical bond angle in 'polymer'-command to allow creation of helixes or DNA.
(b) Added the Morse-potential to Espresso.
(a) Added new analysis routine
    'analyze cell_gpb <Manning parameter> <outer cell radius> <inner cell radius> [<accuracy> [<# of interations>]]'
    for determining the numerical solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation in the cell model.

Changes:
(f) Removed the buggy, non-interpolating version of the P3M charge assignment;
    anyways, the gain is only around 10%.
(f) Some improvements in the P3M charge assignment.
(d) Changed 'sprintf' in the runtime_errors to the new ERROR_SPRINTF-macro
(c) Reduced the minimal number of cells to the correct number 8.
(b) Reduced PARTICLE_INCREMENT to 8 as it does not cost anything, but reduces 
    the amount of memory used.
(b) RATTLE is slightly faster as the tolerance conditions are now verified

(b) December  1st, 2004.
(a) November 30th, 2004.

New Features:
(i) Added new optional option 'angle <angle>' to the polymer command, allowing to create
    polymers within the freely-rotating chain model.
(e) Added a new 'writepdbtopo' which uses the new 'analyze get_folded_positions'-function 
    to write a pdb file using folded molecule information.
(e) Added a new 'analyze' command 'get_folded_positions' which allows the user to get 
    folded particle positions out to the tcl level.  The most important flag to this 
    is '-molecule' which folds the system using topology information before constructing 
    the output. It is also possible to shift in x, y, or z directions prior to folding.
(c) Masses have now also been added to the 'chain_rdf' function.
(b) Comfixed potential now also works with different masses on the particles.
(b) Rewrote checkpointing to be able to save disk space by removing repeating informations:
    Added new options 'COMPACT_CHK' to 'checkpoint_set', which'll take care of this, if enabled.

Changes:
(g) Replaced the O(N^2)-loop in the aggregation analysis tool.

Bugfixes:
(h) Updated the data of the 'analysis'-testcase to include the 'analyze <g3>' corrected in v1.8.2d
(h) Fixed a bug that actually prevented reconstruction of the data files in the 'analysis'-testcase.
(g) Removed quotes from appended items to 'part_write' in 'poly_block_write'. Use of quotes 
    resulted in a tcl list being appended rather than a single item thereby preventing the 
    'part'-command to execute.  Also added an extra check for ELECTROSTATICS.
(g) Fixed a memory allocation bug in the aggregation analysis tool.
(g) Fixed a buffer overflow in the 'polymer'-command on Darwin occuring when the bonded potential
    to be used had not been created before execution of the command.
(f) The 'analyze aggregation'-command now calculates correct standard deviation.
(d) Re-fixed wrong renormalization in 'analyze g3'.
(b) Fixed yet another bug in 'pair_dist' which used to not use the 2nd particle's z-component,
    while now (after HL's rewrite) taking the wrong particle identities to derive the distance.
(b) Fixed wrong renormalization in 'analyze g3'.
(a) Lots of fixes to the documentation.
(a) Fixed missing #ifdef BOND_CONSTRAINT in the interaction processing.

- v1.8.0a -
-----------

(a) October 18th, 2004.

New Features:
(a) Masses have been added to ESPResSo which may be enabled using the compilerflag MASS
    in config.h (the usual place for such flags). 
    This also required introduction of a macro PMASS, representing the mass of a particle,
    which returns 1 if masses are disabled; all these products the compiler should then
    optimize away such that without masses nothing should've changed in the final binary.
    Nevertheless the introduction of masses naturally demands a thorough re-write of the
    entire code to make sure that no spot where masses belong is overlooked.
    So far the core system (I/O, integration with thermostat, NpT, pressure) works, but 
    most of the analysis routines, the blockfile procedures, checkpointing, and all of
    the non-standard additions have not yet been adapted; other mass-dependent stuff
    has already been added (e.g. Rattle) without being fully functional yet.

- v1.7.6e -
-----------

(e) October   17th, 2004.
(d) October   11th, 2004.
(c) October    8th, 2004.
(b) October    6th, 2004.
(a) September 28th, 2004.

New Features:
(d) Added Xeon CPU to the list of platforms to optimize for.
(c) Added support for FFTW version 3. When electrostatics/p3m is used, the Fast
    Fourier Transform should run faster with the new version. Use switch
    USEFFTW3=yes in the Makefile.$PLATFORM to use this feature. If fftw3 is not
    installed on your system, use the default switch USEFFTW3=no or install fftw3,
    which you can get at www.fftw.org.
    Be aware of different definition of fftw_complex type in fftw2 and fftw3.
(b) Documentation update including new sections in the Programmer's Guide 
    and informations on the cellsystem.

Changes:
(e) Two changes to avoid memory starvation due to too small cells:
    - min_num_cells allows to define a minimal number of cells.
    - p3m tunev2 honors this by ignoring impossible r_cuts.
(a) Some changes in the automatic documentation system:
    DOT is now again off, since e.g. interaction_data.h is unreadable otherwise.
    Some features like electrostatics are now turned on in the documentation,
    which prevents contentless pages for e.g. P3M, and lots of warnings.

Bugfixes:
(c) Fixed a bug in ELC which effectively prevented the tuning.
(a) Fixed Makefile such that you can change the compiler and still use MPIFAKE or MPICH.


- v1.7.6e -
-----------

(e) October   17th, 2004.
(d) October   11th, 2004.
(c) October    8th, 2004.
(b) October    6th, 2004.
(a) September 28th, 2004.

New Features:
(d) Added Xeon CPU to the list of platforms to optimize for.
(c) Added support for FFTW version 3. When electrostatics/p3m is used, the Fast
    Fourier Transform should run faster with the new version. Use switch
    USEFFTW3=yes in the Makefile.$PLATFORM to use this feature. If fftw3 is not
    installed on your system, use the default switch USEFFTW3=no or install fftw3,
    which you can get at www.fftw.org.
    Be aware of different definition of fftw_complex type in fftw2 and fftw3.
(b) Documentation update including new sections in the Programmer's Guide 
    and informations on the cellsystem.

Changes:
(e) Two changes to avoid memory starvation due to too small cells:
    - min_num_cells allows to define a minimal number of cells.
    - p3m tunev2 honors this by ignoring impossible r_cuts.
(a) Some changes in the automatic documentation system:
    DOT is now again off, since e.g. interaction_data.h is unreadable otherwise.
    Some features like electrostatics are now turned on in the documentation,
    which prevents contentless pages for e.g. P3M, and lots of warnings.

- v1.7.4f -
-----------

(f) September 23rd, 2004.
(e) September 21st, 2004.
(d) September 21st, 2004.
(c) September 20th, 2004.
(b) September 16th, 2004.
(a) September 14th, 2004.

New Features:
(f) Added a fake MPI implementation for single CPU jobs (currently only for Linux),
    called MPIFAKE: If set to 'yes', a simple fake MPI implementation (mpi.h/mpi.c)
    is used, which only works on one processor; since most MPI calls are simply 
    empty, single CPU jobs run MUCH faster than before. 
    No fake mpirun is provided, start scripts by 'Linux/Espresso <scriptname>' directly. 
    The testsuite script has a flag -nompi, which does this, to test the fake MPI.
    Of course this does not need a lamd or whatever running in the background...
(e) P3M now has a second tuning mechanism, tunev2, which should be faster than the old
    one in general, but tests possible parameters more thoroughly. It uses a bisection
    to determine r_cut, but, however, still the slow error estimate.
(e) P3M can now be started without interpolation. Setting 'n_interpol' to 0 (which is now 
    also a tuning parameter) switches off both the interpolation of the charge assignment 
    function as well as the saving of the charge fractions. 
    For charge assignment orders below 5 this is faster than the interpolation, while
    higher charge assignment orders are rarely used.
(c) Added ASYNC_BARRIER for easier debugging of the async comm mode. At the beginning 
    of each comm step, there is an MPI_Barrier, which ensure that all nodes have finished 
    the previous command, so that synchronization errors are detected earlier.
(b) There is an additional check for errors right after the integrator's initialization 
    to catch really fundamental problems, which do not allow the force calculation at all.
(a) Added 'add_maggs_yukawa_forces' which was previously ommited.
(a) New test case nve_pe.tcl added. This does an integration in the NVE ensemble 
    with electrostatics, LJ, Fene, and Cosine angular potential.

Bugfixes:
(e) Fixed the bug fix in v1.7.3e regarding force calculation within the new framework: 
    The short ranged parts of electrostatics methods in 'forces.h' are now divided 
    into short and long ranged methods. For the first ones, constituting of just DH, 
    a virial pressure calculation is used, while for the others, currently just P3M, 
    a separate approach is used. All electrostatics methods are now ADDING forces, 
    but the long range ones have to take care of the pressure themselves.
(e) Fixed memory leakage in aggregation routine.
(d) Fixed a bug in cells_update_ghosts which prevented ghost updates using the DOMDEC.
(b) Error in cells_udate_ghosts() for the case of no_verlet_lists has been removed.
(b) Error in the calculation of Yukawa self-forces in the Maggs algorithm has been removed.
(a) Error for the calculation of beta[][] in the Maggs algorithm was cleaned.

(c) September  6th, 2004.
(b) September  3rd, 2004.
(a) September  2nd, 2004.

New Features:
(e) New function 'average <tcl-list>' averages the contents of a tcl-list of values.
(e) Re-entered new function 'polyBlockRead <source>' to read in blockfile 'source'
    which was first added for v1.6.6e but removed in v1.7.3c accidentally.
(e) Re-entered enhancement to 'checkpoint_read <read_all_checkpoints> <write_pdb> <pdb_sfx>'
    to also be able to convert the whole checkpoint-series into a trajectorie / vmd-movie
    which was first added for v1.6.6e but removed in v1.7.3c accidentally.
(c) New auxiliary mathematical functions on tcl-script-level:
    ABHmath.tcl: bond_length, veclensqr, min_img_bond_length, 
    aux.tcl:     calc_aniso_box, system_com
(b) Maggs algorithm for calculation of the electrostatics has been added.
(b) The possibility to run domain decompostion without Verlet list has been added.

Changes:
(e) Function 'average_checkpoint <origin> <what>' replaces former 'average' to more properly 
    display what the function is doing, avoiding confusion with new function 'average' (s.a.).
(c) In 'energy_calc()' in the case of ELECTROSTATICS that energy now defaults to zero.
(a) To prevent the new error handling to accidentally cause memory overflow, its error
    status is now collected twice during each integration cycle (for NPT only at the moment).

Bugfixes:
(e) Fixed a major bug which caused the force-derivation to overestimate all nonbonded forces
    by a factor of 2 if both nonbonded and electrostatic interactions were present and active;
    this bug was introduced with the new force interface in v1.7.2a and did not affect statics,
    while all trajectories (hence forces, energies) became wrong under the given circumstances.
(d) Fixed bug in 'nemd'-code which did no longer properly check if only one CPU was used.
(c) Fixed bug in 'add_bonded_virials' which prevented non-2-body-interactions to work properly.
(c) Error in 'calc_link_cell_energies' has been fixed.
(b) Fixed a bug which prevented usage of the p3m-tuning on more than one processor.

(c) August   30th, 2004.
(b) August   27th, 2004.
(a) August   26th, 2004.

New Features / Changes:
(a) New force evaluation structure, unified force and energy interfaces 
    for the potentials, and simpler force/pressure/energy evaluation loops.
(a) The derivation of 'p_vir' has been moved out of each potential's header
    file back to the force calculation's main loop; hence from now on it is
    no longer necessary to include it into newly added potentials as long as
    they follow the forces interface introduced thereby.
(a) The derivation of 'analyze pressure', 'analyze p_inst', 'analyze p_IK1',
    'analyze energy' has been adapted to the new force/energy interface.

New Features:
(c) Added error recovery in the case of out of bounds particles.

Changes:
(d) Now you can still run NpT-simulations in 2D or 1D without the -cubic_box option 
    enabled even if electrostatics is compiled in but not used (i.e. bjerrum == 0.0);
    otherwise -cubic_box will automatically be invoked and a warning issued.
(b) Reduced screen output for 'checkpoint_read' with 'only_last' option enabled.

Bugfixes:
(e) Fixed bug in 'mpi_get_particles' when no bond information was requested, 
    the slave still sends some if there are no particles on the slave.
(e) Various fixes to prevent some warnings on Tru64 and Alpha.
(e) Fixed premature 'return'-statement in resurrection of 'analyze Vkappa' (see v1.7.2b).
(d) Fixed some bugs in statistics aggregate function so that it compiles on DEC machines.
(c) Fixed recovery of error handling of negative 'nptiso_volume' in the integrator.
(b) Fixed an endless loop in the error handling if particles moved too far.
(b) Fixed format errors in part of the error handling output.
(b) The tuning of p3m now checks for errors correctly and bails out accordingly.
(b) Re-enabled possibility to re-tune p3m by allowing to disable r_cut again.
(b) Re-entered the enhancement of the analysis routine for estimating volume 
    fluctuations to 'analyze Vkappa [{ reset | read | set <Vk1> <Vk2> <avk> }]'
    allowing the user to save/restore the measurement, which was first added
    for v1.6.5c but removed in v1.6.5d accidentally.
(a) Fixed bug in 'check_particles' when the skin is not yet set.

(a) The derivation of 'analyze pressure', 'analyze p_inst', 'analyze p_IK1',
    'analyze energy' has been adapted to the new force/energy interface.

New Features:
(c) Added error recovery in the case of out of bounds particles.

Changes:
(d) Now you can still run NpT-simulations in 2D or 1D without the -cubic_box option 
    enabled even if electrostatics is compiled in but not used (i.e. bjerrum == 0.0);
    otherwise -cubic_box will automatically be invoked and a warning issued.
(b) Reduced screen output for 'checkpoint_read' with 'only_last' option enabled.

Bugfixes:
(e) Fixed bug in 'mpi_get_particles' when no bond information was requested, 
    the slave still sends some if there are no particles on the slave.
(e) Various fixes to prevent some warnings on Tru64 and Alpha.
(e) Fixed premature 'return'-statement in resurrection of 'analyze Vkappa' (see v1.7.2b).
(d) Fixed some bugs in statistics aggregate function so that it compiles on DEC machines.
(c) Fixed recovery of error handling of negative 'nptiso_volume' in the integrator.
(b) Fixed an endless loop in the error handling if particles moved too far.
(b) Fixed format errors in part of the error handling output.
(b) The tuning of p3m now checks for errors correctly and bails out accordingly.
(b) Re-enabled possibility to re-tune p3m by allowing to disable r_cut again.
(b) Re-entered the enhancement of the analysis routine for estimating volume 
    fluctuations to 'analyze Vkappa [{ reset | read | set <Vk1> <Vk2> <avk> }]'
    allowing the user to save/restore the measurement, which was first added
    for v1.6.5c but removed in v1.6.5d accidentally.
(a) Fixed bug in 'check_particles' when the skin is not yet set.


- v1.7.1c -
-----------

(c) August 26th, 2004.
(b) August 23rd, 2004.
(a) August 20th, 2004.

New Features:
(c) Now the 'mpich'-implementation on Linux64 is available
    in addition to the known 'lam' one via flag in 'Makefile.Linux'.
    Note that you'll need a link to the 'mpich'-implemented 'mpirun' 
    to execute the resulting binary (the default is 'lam's 'mpirun').
(c) New architecture AMD64/Opteron is now supported as well,
    hence we have modified Makefiles with optimized settings.
(b) A new check_particles ADDITIONAL_CHECKS has been added 
    to test the 'part'-command.
(b) Improved method for calculating midpoint of bilayer.

Changes:
(a) Changed the core to procedure something working on SuSE 9.1/AMD64.
(a) Replaced the flag 'COM_on' by some reasonable checks.

Bugfixes:
(b) Fixed a bug in the 'part' command that relied on 'local_particles' 
    to contain physical particles only, although ghosts may be in there, too.
(a) Various fixes in the error handling occuring when switching off parts of the code.

- v1.7.0a -
-----------

(a) August 19th, 2004.

New Features:
(a) A new error handling code has been put into Espresso:
    Instead of the old 'fprintf(stderr, "..."); errexit()' scheme, 
    you have to include "errorhandling.h" and call
	char *errtxt = runtime_error(string_length);
	sprintf(errtxt, "...");
    The string_length just has to be larger than the actual error 
    message, so typically '128+n_i*TCL_INTEGER_SPACE+n_d*TCL_DOUBLE_SPACE' 
    will do.
    Afterwards the program will go on until the runtime errors are collected.
    If you write a new Tcl command, make sure that at the end you call 
    'mpi_gather_runtime_errors(interp, error_code)'. If the error_code is TCL_OK 
    and no runtime errors occured, it will simply return TCL_OK, but if an 
    runtime error occurs, it will be set as the interpreters result. If the state 
    was already TCL_ERROR, the background errors are appended, so the original 
    error message is not lost. In case of errors, the routine returns TCL_ERROR, 
    so in most cases you are done with
        return mpi_gather_runtime_errors(interp, error_code);
    Again, see the code.

Changes:
(a) Changed a lot of 'errexit()'s to using the new 'runtime_error' facility.
(a) The parsers for the tabulated potentials now generate Tcl errors instead of
    'errexit()'s.
(a) All parsers for interactions have been moved to the corresponding force files.

Bugfixes:
(a) A lot of bugfixes all over the place, mostly in the parsers.
(a) The layered cell system is now able to deal with moving particles.
(a) Setting bonds now generates an 'on_particle_change' on ALL nodes.
(a) Fixes for the Tru64 compiler.

- v1.6.6h -
-----------

(h) August 18th, 2004.
(g) August 16th, 2004.
(f) August 13th, 2004.
(e) August 12th, 2004.
(d) August 10th, 2004.
(c) August  2nd, 2004.
(b) July   27th, 2004.
(a) July   27th, 2004.

New Features:
(f) Added new analysis command "analyze aggregation" to analyze the aggregation 
    state of molecules in the system.
(e) Added 'polyBlockRead <source>' to read in blockfile 'source'.
(d) Added Maxwell velocity distribution. 
(d) Added 'analyze activate' to activate one of the stored configurations.
(c) Added a new check for the NPT integrator to the testsuite.  
    The compressibility is calculated from volume fluctuations and compared 
    with a previously calculated value; this value was also checked by calculating 
    the compressibility from the change in pressure with changes in volume.  
    The value obtained by this method deviates at the third significant figure;
    hopefully this means the "fluctuation response theorem" holds for our NPT integrator.
(b) Added new analysis command for lipid bilayers 'analyze lipid_orient_order'.
    It's another command that is really only useful for a bilayer system.
(a) Introduced ghost system flags, at the moment just ghosts_have_v, which
    determines wether when updating the position also the velocity is updated.
    Needed for DPD and RATTLE. Do not directly change the variable, but modify
    the procedure on_ghost_flags_change() and call that.
(a) Added documentation for MMM2D, MMM1D and ELC, and the ghost communication stuff.

Changes:
(h) Improved the algorithm for the calculation of height function in modes analysis.
(h) Improved the parser for get_lipid_orients.  
(h) Merged 'analyze aggregation' with changes to modes analysis.
(d) Changed classification of stray lipids to account for the fact that some lipids 
    will become incorporated into periodic image bilayers. These lipids are still
    discarded in modes analysis but are classified as "STRAY".  
    Lipids which are genuinely floating in space are now classified as "REAL_STRAY".
(a) Moved 'anounce_rebuild_vlist' to 'announce_rebuild_vlist' and changed the MPI
    communications' 'Reduce'/'Bcast' to 'Allreduce'.
(a) Now errors in the 'integrate set' command are actually reported as errors.

Bugfixes:
(g) Fixed bug that after a cells_re_init the ghost cells were resized only
    for domain decomposition. Now this is handled by the cell structure code.
(d) Fixed bug in the mindist which only worked for symmetric sets.
(d) Fixed some bugs in the topology-mol_id sync command so that this now works 
    properly on multiple nodes.
(a) Fixed bug that 'thermostat set' crashes.

- v1.6.5d -
-----------

(d) July 26th, 2004.
(c) July 22nd, 2004.
(b) July 15th, 2004.
(a) July 13th, 2004.

New Features:
(d) Enhanced 'checkpoint_read <read_all_checkpoints> <write_pdb> <pdb_sfx>' to also
    be able to convert the whole checkpoint-series into a trajectorie / vmd-movie 
    '<write_pdb>0000.pdb' ... '<write_pdb>0359.pdb' (if e.g. 360 files were given)
    if <write_pdb>!=0; <pdb_sfx> determines the # of digits to be used while
    enumerating the configurations (defaults to 5).
(c) Enhanced analysis routine for estimating volume fluctuations and the systems'
    compressibility to 'analyze Vkappa [{ reset | read | set <Vk1> <Vk2> <avk> }]'
    allowing the user to save/restore the measurement.
(b) Introduced 'setmd npt_p_diff' to save/restore the content of nptiso.p_diff
    which might be necessary for recovering trajectories using the NpT-integrator.

Changes:
(a) The 'blockfile <channel> write thermostat' now adds an 'off'-statement to the 
    beginning of the thermostat block; this results in all other thermostats being
    deactivated before the stored ones are read in. Contrary to earlier versions,
    any 'temperature' or 'gamma' field before this block will therefore no longer 
    activate the langevin thermostat (a feature present for backwards compatibility
    only; it should no longer be used anyway) unless there's a corresponding entry
    within the thermostat block; however, 'temperature' or 'gamma' fields _after_
    the thermostat block (a big DON'T - always have the setmd-variables as first
    block in your file) will override its content nonetheless.

Bugfixes:
(b) Completed bugfix of 'integrate set npt_isotropic' by having nptiso.non_const_dim 
    be initialized with the same value for flags '1 1 1' and for no flags at all.
(a) Fixed a serious bug in the 'integrate set npt_isotropic' command which occured
    if that command was invoked several times (e.g. by reading in more than one 
    blockfile or checkpoint or by switching from NpT to NVT and back to NpT) while
    supplying the <x> <y> <z> flags each time, causing the internal 'nptiso.volume'
    to be too large because of a too large internal 'nptiso.dimension', resulting
    in too small instantaneous pressures 'npt_p_inst' and consequently to small
    volume adjustments, which consequently resulted in the wrong averaged volumes.
(a) The aforementioned change to the 'blockfile' command also fixes a bug that when
    a full blockfile (containing both 'temperature' and 'thermostat' fields in the
    standard successive order) is read in, the langevin thermostat will be active
    afterwards no matter if it was or was not contained in the 'thermostat' block.

    only; it should no longer be used anyway) unless there's a corresponding entry
    within the thermostat block; however, 'temperature' or 'gamma' fields _after_
    the thermostat block (a big DON'T - always have the setmd-variables as first
    block in your file) will override its content nonetheless.

Bugfixes:
(b) Completed bugfix of 'integrate set npt_isotropic' by having nptiso.non_const_dim 
    be initialized with the same value for flags '1 1 1' and for no flags at all.
(a) Fixed a serious bug in the 'integrate set npt_isotropic' command which occured
    if that command was invoked several times (e.g. by reading in more than one 
    blockfile or checkpoint or by switching from NpT to NVT and back to NpT) while
    supplying the <x> <y> <z> flags each time, causing the internal 'nptiso.volume'
    to be too large because of a too large internal 'nptiso.dimension', resulting
    in too small instantaneous pressures 'npt_p_inst' and consequently to small
    volume adjustments, which consequently resulted in the wrong averaged volumes.
(a) The aforementioned change to the 'blockfile' command also fixes a bug that when
    a full blockfile (containing both 'temperature' and 'thermostat' fields in the
    standard successive order) is read in, the langevin thermostat will be active
    afterwards no matter if it was or was not contained in the 'thermostat' block.

New Features:
(e) Added new analysis routine 'analyze Vkappa' which measures the compressibility
    of the system by looking at the volume fluctuations.

Changes:
(a) Added sqrt(3) factor to the Langevin thermostat for re-entering the integrator
    (only if 'recalc_forces' is set as well, e.g. because a bond was removed, 
    the box rescaled or just the forcecap changed). 
    This is necessary since otherwise the temperature drops with the rate of 
    force recalculations due to missing correlations while drawing random numbers.

Bugfixes:
(f) Rewrote output of 'inter coulomb' to also fix a bug which caused an incomplete
    list to be returned if the command was used without electrostatics turned on.
(f) Fixed blockfile storage of nested lists to prevent increase of outermost bounds.
(d) Fixed bug in the rounding error handling code of fold_coordinate, which caused
    a particle in the unlikely event of rounding error mismatches to not be folded
    by box_l but by the inverse of it (box_l_i).
(c) Fixed bug in inter_print_bonded and inter_print_bond_partners causing loss
    of tabulated interaction data.
(b) Fixed typo in array index causing nptiso.p_vel to be accidentially overwritten
    while deriving virials in 'add_bonded_virials'.

(a) June  8th, 2004.

New Features:
(b) Added new analysis routine 'analyze p_inst' which does exactly the same as
    'analyze pressure' but compensates for the difference in the ideal component
    between 'analyze pressure' and 'setmd npt_p_inst', hence more accurately displaying
    the contributions to the instantaneous pressure while using NpT.
    Note that you may use this function in both NpT- and NVT-ensembles, but be aware
    that since it is reverting the last half timestep in the velocity propagation,
    extra care is required to make sure that such a thing is valid upon execution.
(b) Added new global variable 'setmd npt_p_inst_av' which displays the instantaneous
    pressure of the NpT-integrator averaged over the last integration cycle.
(a) Added flag to 'checkpoint_read <source> [<read_all>]' so that you don't have to 
    read all checkpoints but can just read the last one.

Changes:
(d) Reverted 'add_non_bonded_virials'-calculation of the short range coulombic pressure
    contribution to former potential term, but now nptiso.p_vir is also using it
    in 'add_p3m_coulomb_pair_force' instead of the former virial expression r*F,
    such that now both nptiso.p_vir and 'analyze pressure' and 'analyze p_inst' all
    use U_c/(d*V) for the whole electrostatic pressure component (both r- and k-part).
(c) Now 'add_non_bonded_virials' uses the virial expression r*F for the short range
    coulombic interactions as well instead of the potential term (as for the k-part).
(c) Now internal flag 'nptiso.invalidate_p_vel' helps to decide if there was already
    an NpT-integration step (such that 'analyze p_inst' may use 'nptiso.p_vel') or if
    the secondary timestep reversion has to be used (replaces former box_l-comparision).
(c) Now 'analyze set chains' no longer automatically updates mol_ids.
(a) particles mol_id is now initialized to -1, and this can be used to check whether 
    the mol_id has been set. The topology sync function makes use of this.

Bugfixes:
(d) Fixed that a pressure calculation screwed up nptiso.p_vir when the following
    integration step didn't recalculate the forces (which was possible after v1.6.2b).
(b) Fixed bug that Espresso always recalculated the forces when leaving/reentering the sim loop.
(b) Fixed NpT-integration of systems using electrostatic interactions:
    + The bugs introduced in v1.6.1b by replacing the k-space-energy contribution to
      nptiso.p_vir by some weird k-space-force-components have been undone, hence the
      k-space component of the coulombic pressure should correctly enter p_inst now.
    + The (inverse) mesh constant of the p3m-grid is now scaled with the box-length 
      as well, adjusting lm.ld_pos accordingly to the grid's new position in the box.
      This should prevent mysterious crashes randomly occuring in 'invalidate_ghosts' 
      or 'P3M_calc_k_space_forces' due to invalid grid positions.
    - Fixed output of 'integrate set' for nptiso-parameters.

New Features:

(c) New command 'tune_cells' which adapts the cell-grid towards best performance.
(c) New parameters 'integrator' and 'thermostat' for the 'blockfile'-command
    to also save the correct states (and parameters) of these two subsystems.
(b) New NpT Feature: The NpT-Integrator now accepts two additional arguments. 
    The first is a set of three integers ( x y z ) each of which turns on or off 
    the NpT integrator and thermostat in that direction; a value of 1 turns on
    the box length motion and a value of 0 turns it off.  
    The second new argument is a flag "-cubic_box"; when set, this flag ensures 
    that box length changes are completely isotropic in all directions even 
    though box length changes in one or more of these directions may in fact 
    be decoupled from the particle motion. 
    Internally this has been achieved by splitting up the virial part of the
    instantaneous pressure to nptiso.p_vir[3] reflecting the three directions of
    the pressure tensor. Note that due to its periodicity electrostatic systems
    using p3m are still restricted to 3D-periodic and -isotropic systems!

Changes:
(d) 'writepdbfoldchains' now requires a list of 3 box lengths (as returned from 
    [setmd box_l] ) - old scripts using these features need to be modified.

Bugfixes:
(g) Fixed problem with lipid flip-flop analysis that caused imd to fold incorrectly.
(f) Fixed modes analysis so it doesn't crash ESPResSo when there is a hole in the membrane.
(c) Fixed problems of 'calcObsAv' when a "-" was part of the column headers.

(a) April 22nd, 2004.

New Features / Changes / Bugfixes:
(e) Final NpT-Update: The NpT-Integrator does now run efficiently and smoothly.
    + Unlocked faster re-scaling of just the geometrical parameters of the system
      instead of reinitialising the whole cell system more than necessary (i.e. only
      if max_range > cell_range) in every timestep.
    + Added missing geometrical parameter 'shift' within the GhostCommunication-structures
      within the GhostCommunicator-structures of the 'dd_exchange_and_sort_particles'-regime
      to the rescaling tasks in 'dd_NpT_update_cell_grid'.
    + Until a better criterion is found, the algorithm will renew the Verlet list
      in every timestep - not perfect, but still much better than previous treatment.
    + Finally, fixed a mean bug that rescaling the old positions at the wrong index
      caused the bond-list to be accidentally overwritten with nonsense data.
(d) 1) New bonded potential: torsional dihedral angle potential.
       Syntax is: inter i dihedral <mult> <bend> <phase>
       This is a four body interaction. The bond has to be stored at the
       second particle. For more information see the documentation of the
       tcl inter command and dihedral.h
    2) New tabulated bonded potentials:
       Syntax is: inter i tabulated <type> <filename>
       There are three types implemented, namely "bond" for a
       tabulated bond length potential, "angle" for a tabulated bond
       angle potential and "dihedral" for a tabulated dihedral
       potential. The file format for the tabulated force and energy
       value is the same as for the non-bonded tabulated
       potential. For more information see the documentation of the
       tcl inter command and tab.h. WARNING: I had no time to test the
       tabulated dihedral angle potential yet.
    3) New global variables: max_cut_non_bonded, max_range_non_bonded and max_range_non_bonded2
       These variables have to do with the maximal interaction range
       of non-bonded and short range electrostatic potentials and are
       used by the verlet pair list algorithms. They are defined
       similar to the variables max_cut, max_range and
       max_range2. They keep the Verlet pair lists smaller, if the
       maximal interaction range for non-bonded potentials is smaller
       then the maximal interaction range of bonded interactions in
       the system. This has no effect on the cell_structure nad the
       communication of ghost particles.
(a) Major NpT-Update: The NpT-Integrator does now work properly, though still not at top efficiency.
    + The code no longer crashes when updating ghost particles after enforcing a 'cells_re_init'.
    + Now the new box-length is communicated after the particles are rescaled.
    + Fixed wrong p_vel that always had p_vel updated after velocities were propagated.
    + Fixed wrong friction_g0-contribution due to new (instead of old) velocities as arguments.
    - Slimlined 'dd_NpT_update_cell_grid' to increase processing speed; it also got the scaling
      factor as argument (passed by 'on_NpT_boxl_change') to improve the 'max_range'-criterion.
    - Temporarily deactivated 'cells_re_init'-shortcut as it's not yet working;
      expect a speedup of 40x...90x once it's done.
    + Now the old particle positions are rescaled as well.

New Features:
(e) Added poststore and prefetch to domain decomposition.
(d) Implemented cutoff and range variables for verlet pair algorithm.
(c) Added EVENT_TRACEs.
(b) Added warning when pressure is calculated while MMM2D/MMM1D are on.
(b) Added ADDITIONAL_CHECK for particles outside the allowed box.

Bugfixes:
(e) Fixed bug that electrostatic energy was written even if no electrostatics
    were set, causing a core dump.
(c) Now box length can no longer be zero.
(b) Bugfix that not the full sum over p,q was done.

New Features / Changes / Bugfixes:
(e) Final NpT-Update: The NpT-Integrator does now run efficiently and smoothly.
    + Unlocked faster re-scaling of just the geometrical parameters of the system
      instead of reinitialising the whole cell system more than necessary (i.e. only
      if max_range > cell_range) in every timestep.
    + Added missing geometrical parameter 'shift' within the GhostCommunication-structures
      within the GhostCommunicator-structures of the 'dd_exchange_and_sort_particles'-regime
      to the rescaling tasks in 'dd_NpT_update_cell_grid'.
    + Until a better criterion is found, the algorithm will renew the Verlet list
      in every timestep - not perfect, but still much better than previous treatment.

(a) March 21st, 2004.

New Features:
(g) Writing out of far cut of MMM2D/ELC.
(f) Electrostatic charged plane potential 'plate' added.
(f) Added check for too far movement to ADDITIONAL_CHECKS.
(f) Now TK and other graphical output is also supported on Darwin
    using darwinlink.sh: adds Mac OS resource fork after linking.
(f) Optimized compiler-flags for Pentium-M and -III on Linux.
(e) Added new analyzation command 'analyze necklace' to examine 
    the structure of e.g. polyelectrolytes in poor solvent.

Changes:
(g) Cell structure 'layered' now also uses the 'rebuild_verletlist' 
    flag to avoid unnecessary updates.
(f) Changed constraint 'rod' to be purely electrostatic;
    Use a 'cylinder' to create the excluded volume separately.
(f) Reversed vector treatment ('mmm2d.c').
(f) Added check for too far movement to ADDITIONAL_CHECKS.
(e) Moved verlet update to 'cells.c'; now it is also more general, 
    as is 'layered.c'.
(b) Setting 'setmd piston 0.0' now disables the nptiso-thermostat
    (if compiled in), otherwise it does no longer complain about
    that (essentially) improper value for compatibility reasons.

Bugfixes:
(h) Fixed a bug in 'cells_update_ghosts' that caused the ghost-communicator
    to be executed twice; hence, the code should be faster now.
(g) Fixed major bug that setting the skin too late in the script file
    did not change the maximal interaction range, resulting in cells
    becoming too small; as a consequence, interactions might have
    been omitted on course of the simulation.
(g) Fixed bug that switching off electrostatics was sometimes not possible.
(g) Fixed bug that max range was not set often enough.
(g) Fixed bug in constraint rod.
(f) Fixed debug statements when THERMO_DEBUG is switched on.
(f) Fixed bug in 'layered.c' that p_old was not updated.
(f) Fixed bug in near formula for precisions below 10^-10 ('mmm2d.c').
(d) MPI_GET_PARTICLES fixed to allow empty nodes and bonds.
(c) Fixed several compiler issues on the OSF1-architectures in
    'Makefile.OSF1' (now enforcing std.C which in turn enables
    useful warnings), 'statistics_chain.c' (pow -> SQR), 'imd.c'
    and 'mmm2d.c'.
(b) Fixed wrong parsing of chain structure info if given in addition
    to one of the analyze-commands in 'statistics_chain.c', e.g.
    'analyze re [<chain_start> <n_chains> <chain_length>]'; now,
    supplying the optional parameters will no longer result in the
    (unfounded) error message 'only chain structure info required'.
(a) Fixed severe bug in 'add_bonded_virials' which caused the bonded
    component of the pressure to be derived falsely. This error was
    introduced with the new system structure in v1.5.Alpha, so all
    pressure results produced with that or later versions should be
    re-derived; however, the actual simulation -as long as it's script
    did not depend on the pressure results- was not affected by this.
    Due to the internal storage policy of ESPResSo (forces are rescaled
    by 0.5*timestep^2) the deviation to the true bonded pressure scales
    with the timestep: As smaller it was as less noticable this error
    should have been in your simulations.

(a) March  5th, 2004.

New Features:
(d) Added a new analysis command [analyze modes2d] which is designed
    to allow a fluctuation analysis of a lipid membrane system.  This
    command is currently restricted to a special type of membrane
    configuration.  A more generalized command and related tcl scripts for
    processing the results will be added later.

Changes:
(b) [analyze bond_l] now returns a four member list with the average, standard deviation, 
    maximum value and minumum value of the sample; the same holds true for 
    [analyze <bond_l>], however, note that now it returns the maximum/minimum 
    in all the configurations and the values don't have to belong to same chain. 
    It was done this way to ensure uniformity. The testsuite has been adapted to this.
(b) In statistics_chain.c, the bond length calculations have been modified. It 
    actually calculates the average now (not the root mean square avg as was done 
    before); the error is taken as one standard deviation.

Bugfixes:
(c) Falsely calling 'analyze nbhood' without any arguments no longer unintentionally
    crashes the program but returns an appropriate error message instead.
(a) Added nptiso-thermostat random noise to 2nd propagation of the velocities as well.
(a) Fixed wrongly scaled prefactors of the nptiso-thermostat which do now remember
    to include an additional 'time_step' for the propagated velocities.

New Features:
(b) Introduced new structure 'nptiso' in which all global variables
    related to the NpT-integration-scheme are contained.
(b) Now 'integrate' returns integrator informations, too, as well as
    'thermostat set <what>' may be used instead of 'thermostat <what>.

Changes:
(b) P3M is now entirely scaling invariant, replacing 'alpha' and 'r_cut'
    by rescaled 'alpha_L' and 'r_cut_iL'; for performance reasons the
    forces- and energy-derivation is still using the unscaled versions,
    so are the I/O-routines.
(b) Exchanged virial criterion 'if(piston!=0.0)' by test for 'integ_switch'
    in all functions deriving forces; should result in a speed-up if compiled in.
(a) Replaced p3m.alpha and p3m.r_cut with rescaled versions p3m.alpha_L and p3m.r_cut_iL
    which renders the p3m-algorithm to be independent of box_l.
    The old alpha and r_cut do still exist, mainly for I/O- and speed-purposes
    (since the forces- and energy-routine in p3m.h use both).

Bugfixes:
(b) Fixed wrong and/or missing safety checks for nptiso-integrator.
(b) Fixed handling of missing exceptions in 'thermostat set'.

	     please let us know).
	   - thermostat off turns all thermostats off and sets all

    Kolb, Duenweg, J.Chem.Phys. 111(8) 4453 (1999).
    To activate it, use the corresponding compiler-flag in 'config.h'
    and set the new parameters 'piston', 'g0', 'gv', and 'p_ext'.

(a) February 9th, 2004.

New Features:
(a) introducing topoplogy concept.

Changes:
(a) 'analyze set chains <start> <N_P> <MPC>' does now set the topology,
    hence 'analyze set chains' has been discontinued.

Bugfixes:
(a) fixed severe bug that had the p3m tuning routine to not allocate
    the appropriate amount of memory for the final parameter set, but
    used the last trial's settings instead.

- v1.5.1b -
-----------

(b) February 6th, 2004.
(a) January 30th, 2004.

New Features:
(b) Inplementation of NEMD (Non Equilibrium Molecular Dynamics). This method
    introduces a shear rate corresponding to a Couette flow by artificially
    pumping energy into the system via a momentum exchange between two slabs
    of the system. For more information see for example Evans/Morriss:
    Statistical mechanics of Nonequilibrium Liwuids (Academic Press, London,
    1990) or Soddemann/Duenweg/Kremer (Phys. Rev. E; 68; 2003).
    All procedures reside in the fiiles nemd.c/h. 
    Usage of the new tcl command nemd:
         nemd - returning nemd status
	 nemd off - turn off nemd
	 nemd exchange <INT n_slabs> <INT n_exchange>
              - enable method exchange momentum 
	 nemd shearrate <INT n_slabs> <DOUBLE shearrate>
              - enable method with fixed shear rate
	 nemd profile - return the velocity profile
	 nemd viscosity - return the viscosity
    Notes: - The slabs are oriented perpendicualr to the z direction.
           - The shear is applied in x direction
           - Use only with a DPD thermostat or in an NVE ensemble.
           - Do not use other special features like part fix or 
	     constraints inside the top and middle slab.
	   - Per default NEMD is not compiled in.
(a) The bond angle potential can now be used also for equilibrium angles different
    from 180 degree (stretched configuration). This should not affect any previous
    simulations (except numerical errors). The default potential form is now:
    V = k (1+cos(phi+phi0)).
(a) With help of compiler flags used as switch you can now choose between three
    different potential forms (the corresponding #define statements are as usual
    in config.h):
    BOND_ANGLE_HARMONIC   ->  V = 1/2 k (phi - phi0)^2
    BOND_ANGLE_COSINE     ->  V = k (1+cos(phi-phi0))
    BOND_ANGLE_COSSQUARE  ->  V = 1/2 k (cos(phi)-cos(phi0))^2

- v1.5.Alpha -
-----------

(b) January 15th, 2004.
(a) January  7th, 2004.

New Features:
(a) new command 'cellsystem { domain | nsquare }' to choose the internal particle structure.
(a) comfixed interaction is implemented. This interaction fixes the center of mass 
    of all particles of a given type.
(a) comforce interaction is implemented. This interaction is used to apply a force 
    on two differenent types of particles. The force is applied either along the
    major axis of type_1 particles (e.g. bundle of rods), or perpendicular to the 
    major axis of type_1 particles in the direction of the vector joining center
    of mass's of type_1 and type_2.

Changes:
(b) 'analyze pressure ideal' does no longer use n_total_particles*temperature/volume but rather
    measures the particles' velocities to deduct the ideal gas contribution to the pressure
    from there; consequently, its value is at last the very same as the trace of p_IK1;
    note however, that the ideal gas now depends on whether or not ROTATION is compiled in
    (changing the degrees of freedom from 3 to 6), even if the particles don't use that property
(b) 'checkpoint_set' now also saves informations on external forces, fixed particles, and
    rotational properties if the corresponding flags are compiled in.
(a) completely reworked the internal particle structure, now having six substructures per particle
    and a choice of two entirely different particle administration systems (domain decomposition
    or homogeneous N^2-mode)

Bugfixes:
(b) fixed several memory leaks occuring when using newer version of the gcc-compiler
(b) fixed wrong prefactor of 'analyze pressure ideal' contained in early versions of v1.5.Alpha
(a) 'part fix' fixed
(a) the constraint energy is printed correctly now. In the old version, if 
    the constraint particle type is smaller than any real particle type, 
    the constraint energy was wrong, even though the total energy was correct

- v1.1.0e -
-----------

(e) December  2nd, 2003.
(d) November 18th, 2003.
(c) November 13th, 2003.
(b) November 11th, 2003.
(a) November  3rd, 2003.

New Features:
(e) command 'constraint maze' to create a constraint with a maze-like structure,
    i.e. spheres connected by cylinders 
(d) command 'imd positions' has new optional flag '-fold_chains'
(c) command 'part fix' has new optional parameters, i.e. 'part fix [<x> <y> <z>]'
(b) command 'analyze p_IK1' replacing 'analyze p_bin'
(a) command 'analyze p_bin' to derive the pressure tensor of a given particle list
(a) command 'analyze bin' to create a particle list distributed into spherical bins

Bugfixes:
(e) fixed 'tuning.c' on Darwin-systems (e.g. MacOS)
(e) fixed that 'communication.c' would not compile without electrostatics-flag on
(b) fixed implementation of 'analyze p_bin' to correspond to Kirkwood's IK1-scheme
(a) fixed that 'analyze <g1>' and 'analyze <g2>' derived all of <g1>, <g2>, and <g3>
    and always returned <g3> only
