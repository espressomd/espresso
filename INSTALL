******************************************************************************

The ESPResSo compilation and installation process is decribed in
detail in the ESPResSo user's guide. When you have obtained the
sources in a .tar.gz file, the user's guide can be found in the file
"ug.pdf" in the subdirectory "doc/ug/" relative to the directory where
this file resided.

When you have obtained the sources from the git repository or by other
means, the user's guide can be found on the ESPResSo-Homepage at

	http://espressomd.org


QUICK START - CMake (Recommended)
---------------------------------
The recommended way is to build by the cmake tool.
CMake recommends to build in a build directory not inside the
source. On Linux you can create and enter directory in a location
of your choice by

> mkdir <path-to-build-dir> && cd <path-to-build-dir>

Then you can run cmake and build ESPResSo by

> cmake <path-to-espresso-source>
> make

If you have installed the curses frontend to cmake you can see
and modify the build options graphically by running

> ccmake <path-to-espresso-source>

When these steps have completed successfully, you can run Espresso with
help of the command

> ./Espresso

QUICK START - Autotools (Deprecated)
------------------------------------
In most cases, once you have obtained the sources, compiling and
running ESPResSo requires only two steps:

> ./configure
> make
 
If you have the development sources (obtained from out git source code
repository), you first have to execute

> ./bootstrap.sh

to generate the required configure script. 

When these steps have completed successfully, you can run Espresso with
help of the command

> ./Espresso
