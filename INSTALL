*                  ESPResSo installation guide
******************************************************************************

1. Requirements

ESPResSo needs Tcl 8.3 or later, although some example scripts will only work
with Tcl 8.4. You do not only need the interpreter, but also the header files
and libraries, which often come in separate development packages. If you want to
use a GUI for your simulation scripts, you need Tk as well.

In addition, ESPResSo needs the FFTW library for Fourier transforms. ESPResSo
compiles against both the 2.1.x and 3.0.x series. Again you need the development
package containing the header files.

Finally, if you want to use MPI, you need a working MPI environment. ESPResSo
currently works with the following MPI implementations:

1. LAM/MPI is the preferred variant
2. MPICH, which seems to be considerably slower than LAM/MPI in our benchmarks.
3. On AIX systems, ESPResSo can also use the native POE parallel environment
4. On DEC/Compaq/HP OSF/Tru64, ESPResSo can also use the native dmpirun MPI
   environment.

Again, make sure that you have the necessary header files installed.

2. Basic Installation

ESPResSo has a autoconf configure script, which should detect most of the
necessary settings automatically, so that a simple

./configure && make

in the ESPResSo main directory should build ESPResSo, provided all the necessary
components as described above are found.

3. Customizing

The configure script offers various possibilities to manually specify compiler
flags etc. if the configure script fails to work, for example since the CPU type
was not detected properly.

3.1. CPU type detection

The CPU type is detected by the config/config.guess script, which is a
nonstandard version which on some architectures tries to provide a finer CPU
type specification to support CPU specific optimization. If you do not like the
<cpu>-<vendor>-<os> output for your CPU, fix it and please report the settings to
espresso@mpip-mainz.mpg.de for inclusion in the next ESPResSo versions.

3.2. Important environment variables

If you want to manually specify compiler flags, for example special paths to
libraries, you can specify the CC, CFLAGS, LDFLAGS and LIBS environment variables
on the command line:

CC	gives the compiler to use. Note that MPI environments often need special
	compilers rsp. wrapper scripts.
CFLAGS	flags used in the object file compilation pass. Typically you will specify
	additional include paths here, e.g. "-I/home/me/include", but also other
	compiler flags such as "-O5" are possible. In the latter case, you will
	probably want to disable the automated CPU optimization detection via
	"--disable-processor-optimization".
LDFLAGS the same as CFLAGS for the linking pass. Note that you should NOT
	specify libraries here, since for some compilers they have to appear at
	the end of the line, only additional library paths, e.g. "-L/home/me/lib".
LIBS	Use this variable to specify additional libraries to link against, e.g.
	"-lmycoollib".

3.3 Configuration switches

The configure script also has some switches to influence the auto detection

  --enable-mode           specify the compilation mode, either production,
                          debug or profiling. Default is production.
  --disable-processor-optimization
                          disable guessing of processor specific optimizations, if
                          you want to specify it manually.
  --enable-config=cfg     use a predefined configuration for known brain
                          damaged system setups, currently supported: blade
                          (Garching Blade Center), thalpha (DEC Alphas at MPIP).
                          This just provides some wisdom on the cryptic paths on
                          these systems containing the compilers, libraries or paths.
  --disable-mpi           disables the use of MPI and builds an ESPResSo version optimized
                          for single CPU usage.
  --enable-mpi=<type>     compile with MPI (parallelization) support. If you
                          specify <type>=lam,mpich,poe or dmpi the corresponding MPI
                          implementation will used, otherwise configure tries to find
                          the MPI environment automatically. Currently it will look
                          for LAM/MPI and MPICH, or on AIX for poe and on Tru64 for
                          dmpirun.
  --enable-efence         use ElectricFence memory debugging for the debug
                          binary. Used for debugging memory allocation bugs.
  --disable-xlc-qipa      disable the IPA of the IBM C compiler at linking. This is
                          necessary if you get messages about missing "*.dylib" files.
  --enable-tcl            specify the tcl library to use (e.g. tcl8.4). This is the name
                          of the library to use, i.e. to use "-ltclmyversion", specify
                          "--enable-tcl=tclmyversion".
  --enable-tk             tk version for the GUI to use. Tk is disabled by default, using
                          this switch enables autodetection. Specifying
                          "--enable-tk=tkmyversion" works exactly as for Tcl.
  --enable-fftw=<version> specify the version of FFTW to use (2 or 3). This only influences
                          the version to use, to actually specify a different library name,
                          use CFLAGS, LDFLAGS and LIBS to include the necessary
                          paths manually.
  --prefix=<path>         ESPResSo can be run directly from the compilation directory,
                          but on some systems it may be preferable to install a minimal
                          ESPResSo somewhere else. For example one can have the
                          source code on local scratch space, and only the
                          binary in the NFS home directory.

3.4. Example

./configure --enable-mpi=mpich CC=icc CFLAGS="-I/home/me/include" \
	LDFLAGS="-L/home/me/libs" LIBS="-ldoublefftw" \
	--enable-fftw=3

will for example compile ESPResSo using the Intel C Compiler "icc" with the
MPICH environment (which has to be found in one of the usual places, such as
/opt/mpich/p4). A nonstandard FFTW3 library named "doublefftw" is installed in
the home directory of user "me".

4. Building

Once the configure script succeeded in creating the necessary Makefile for the
Hardware, use "make" to build ESPResSo. If this succeeds, you can use "make
install" to install ESPResSo to the location speficied by --prefix to
./configure. This step is optional. However, if you do not install ESPReSo, the
environment variable ESPRESSO_SOURCE has to point to the Espresso source
directory, and ESPRESSO_SCRIPTS has to point to the scripts subdirectory,
otherwise Espresso will not run.

"make docu" will build the documentation using doxygen, and "make install-doc"
will again install the documentation.

5. Testing

If you plan to run Espresso for production jobs, you may be interested in first
making sure that ESPResSo works correctly. To this aim, ESPResSo has a testsuite,
which you can and SHOULD run by "make test" (see also 5. Running if make test
cannot start ESPResSo).

5. Running

If you installed ESPResSo, and the binary directory <prefix>/bin (rsp. whatever
you specified to --exec-prefix) is in your path, ESPResSo is simply run via
"Espresso <script.tcl> ?N_processors? ?args?" without any other prerequisites.

If you want to run ESPResSo from the source directory, the environment variable
ESPRESSO_SOURCE has to point to the Espresso source directory, and
ESPRESSO_SCRIPTS has to point to the scripts subdirectory. If this is the case,
ESPResSo can be started via "<source_dir>/Espresso <script.tcl> ?N_processors?
?args?".

Note that depending on your MPI installation, MPI jobs can only be run in the
queueing system, so that ESPResSo will not run from the command line. In that
case, you may not be able to run the testsuite, or have to directly submit
the testsuite script "testsuite/test.sh" to the queueing system.

6. Good luck in using ESPResSo!

*          Generic autoconf installation instructions
******************************************************************************

   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, a file
`config.cache' that saves the results of its tests to speed up
reconfiguring, and a file `config.log' containing compiler output
(useful mainly for debugging `configure').

   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
be considered for the next release.  If at some point `config.cache'
contains results you don't want to keep, you may remove or edit it.

   The file `configure.in' is used to create `configure' by a program
called `autoconf'.  You only need `configure.in' if you want to change
it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `configure' itself.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
     the package.

  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
     with the distribution.

Compilers and Options
=====================

   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
the `configure' script does not know about.  You can give `configure'
initial values for variables by setting them in the environment.  Using
a Bourne-compatible shell, you can do that on the command line like
this:
     CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure

Or on systems that have the `env' program, you can do it like this:
     env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ./configure

Compiling For Multiple Architectures
====================================

   You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
own directory.  To do this, you must use a version of `make' that
supports the `VPATH' variable, such as GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.

   If you have to use a `make' that does not supports the `VPATH'
variable, you have to compile the package for one architecture at a time
in the source code directory.  After you have installed the package for
one architecture, use `make distclean' before reconfiguring for another
architecture.

Installation Names
==================

   By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
option `--prefix=PATH'.

   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
give `configure' the option `--exec-prefix=PATH', the package will use
PATH as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
Documentation and other data files will still use the regular prefix.

   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
options like `--bindir=PATH' to specify different values for particular
kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
you can set and what kinds of files go in them.

   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.

Optional Features
=================

   Some packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to
`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
They may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE
is something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).  The
`README' should mention any `--enable-' and `--with-' options that the
package recognizes.

   For packages that use the X Window System, `configure' can usually
find the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,
you can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and
`--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.

Specifying the System Type
==========================

   There may be some features `configure' can not figure out
automatically, but needs to determine by the type of host the package
will run on.  Usually `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints
a message saying it can not guess the host type, give it the
`--host=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name with three fields:
     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM

See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If
`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
need to know the host type.

   If you are building compiler tools for cross-compiling, you can also
use the `--target=TYPE' option to select the type of system they will
produce code for and the `--build=TYPE' option to select the type of
system on which you are compiling the package.

Sharing Defaults
================

   If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share,
you can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives
default values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.

Operation Controls
==================

   `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
operates.

`--cache-file=FILE'
     Use and save the results of the tests in FILE instead of
     `./config.cache'.  Set FILE to `/dev/null' to disable caching, for
     debugging `configure'.

`--help'
     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.

`--quiet'
`--silent'
`-q'
     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To
     suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null' (any error
     messages will still be shown).

`--srcdir=DIR'
     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.

`--version'
     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
     script, and exit.

`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.
