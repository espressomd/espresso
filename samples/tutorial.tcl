# Introduction:                                             #
# The aim of this tutorial is to get known to the most      #
# common additional tcl commands which will enable you      #
# to write your own ESPResSo simulation script.             #
# The Tutorial is organized in sections each of which       #
# introduces the usage of one feature of ESPResSo. A        #
# comment block will tell you what has to be done.          #
# It is best if you open the additional commands page of    #
# the ESPResSo documentation to look up the syntax of       #
# the needed commands.                                      #
# On your way through the tutorial you will also learn      #
# some basics about tcl.                                    #
# After succesfully finishing a section remove the 'exit'   #
# command and move on to the next section                   #

# 2 Preparing a System                                      #
# In the tutorial we want to simulate a polyelectrolyte     #
# solution in an NVT ensemble. The System will contain a    #
# polyelectrolyte chain of 40 charged monomers (charge 1.0) #
# and 40 counterions (charge -1.0) at a number density of   #
# 0.001                                                     #
# Create variables for the chain length, the number of      #
# counterions and the density. Calculate the volume of the  #
# system and the corresponding simulation box length        #
# assuming a cubic simulation box.                          #
# TIP:                                                      #
# Store calculated values in tcl variables so that they     #
# can be used later on. Control your results with help of   #
# the 'puts' command                                        #
#                                                           #
# TCL:                                                      #
# Variables in tcl are created with the 'set' command:      #
# set <variable_name> <value>                               #
# You can reference to that variable later on by preceeding #
# its name with a $ sign:                                   #
# $<variable_name>                                          #
# Example:                                                  #
# set a 20                                                  #
# puts $a                                                   #
#                                                           #
# More TCL:                                                 #
# Since tcl is a string oriented language calculations have #
# to be done using the 'expr' command:                      #
# [expr <analytical expression>]                            #
# will return the value of <analytical expression>          #
# Example:                                                  #
# set a 20; set b 5                                         #
# set res [expr $a*$b]                                      #
# puts $res                                                 #

# To tell ESPResSo to use an NVT ensemble use the           #
# additional command 'integrate'.                           #
# Use the additional command 'thermostat' to enable a       #

# We need a bond potential for the polyelectrolyte,         #
# excluded volume interactions and a coulomb interaction.   #
# Setting interactions is done with the additional command  #
# 'inter'                                                   #
#                                                           #
# For the bond we use a FENE potential with k_fene=7.0 and  #
# r_fene=2.0. (use <bond_type_number> 0)                    #
#                                                           #
# The excluded volume interaction will be a purely          #
# repulsive lennard-jones interactions. The parameter set is#

# 7 Warmup                                                  #
# Since we randomly placed the particles we have to         #
# push the ones that are too close to each other appart.    #
# Otherwise you can run into troubles with the singularity  #
# of the Lennard-Jones interaction.                         #
#                                                           #
# To avoid this singularity ESPResSo offers the             #
# possibility to cap potentials. Look at the 'forcecap'     #
# option of the 'inter' command. We start with a value of   #
# 10 for the cap and increase it step wise.                 #
#                                                           #
# The particles will be pushed away from each other in an   #
# integration loop. Below you see the empty structure       #
# for this loop. The tcl 'while' loop has pretty much the   #
# same structure as for example in C. The same holds for    #
# other loop constructions or conditions like 'for' or 'if' #
# Fill in the missing lines after the comments              #
#                                                           #
# To check the status of the sytem we perform the first     #
# analysis of the system. This is done with the             #
# additional command 'analyze <observable>'. In this case   #
# the observable is the minimal distance between any two    #
# particles which is called 'mindist'                       #

# Now everything is working you can play arround with it:   #
# 1) Change the Bjerrum length to observe the exciting chain#
# extension behavior of polyelectrolytes.                   #
# 2) Even more fun can be obtained if you move to poor      #
# solvent conditions by changing the monomer-monomer        #
# interaction (inter 0 0 len...) from purely repulsive to   #
# attractive. Simply Increase the lennard-jones cutoff to   #
# 2.5 and play with the epsilon value.                      #
